# Services

We offer dedicated **training programs** for students and academic institutions. Our goal is to make advanced simulation and modeling techniques accessible to learners of all levels.

Through our Academy initiative, we provide:

- **Software training** — hands-on sessions to learn and master Comfor
- **Simulation fundamentals** — courses covering the principles and best practices of modern simulation

These programs are designed to help students and educators build strong technical foundations and apply simulation tools effectively in real-world scenarios.

# Collaboration

We actively collaborate with universities, research labs, and educational institutions on **research and development projects**. We are open to partnerships that explore innovation, applied research, and new simulation methodologies.

Together, we can:

- Develop and test new simulation techniques
- Co-supervise academic or research projects
- Support student-led initiatives and engineering challenges

If your institution is looking for an academic or industrial partner in simulation and modeling, **we are ready to work with you**.
