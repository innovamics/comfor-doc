# Services

Through the **Comfor Academy**, we provide dedicated training programs for
students, researchers, and academic institutions.  
Our goal is to make advanced simulation techniques for **composite forming and
processing** accessible to learners of all levels, helping them gain confidence,
efficiency, and save valuable time in their thesis or research preparation.

# Training Programs

Our academic training is focused on bridging theory and practice in numerical  
simulation.

We offer:

- **Simulation with Comfor**: hands-on sessions to learn, use, and master the
  Comfor environment for material forming and contact mechanics  
- **Scientific software development**: courses coveqring the fundamentals and
  best practices of modern C++ and Python development applied to simulation and
  research workflows  

These programs help students and educators build strong technical foundations,
develop research autonomy, and apply simulation tools effectively to real
engineering or scientific challenges.

# Collaboration

We actively collaborate with universities, research laboratories, and academic
partners on **research and development projects**.  
Our aim is to accelerate innovation and promote open, reproducible science in
the field of composites simulation.

Together, we can:
- Develop and validate new simulation techniques  
- Propose and implement advanced constitutive models  
- Co-supervise academic theses and research projects  

If your institution is seeking an academic or industrial partner in simulation
and modeling, **we are ready to work with you**.
