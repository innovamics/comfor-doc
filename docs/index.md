**Comfor** is a modern, open-source simulation platform for composite forming
and processing. Built in **C++17/20**, it uses an explicit finite element method
(FEM) tailored to simulate complex manufacturing processes.

Engineered for **modularity**, **transparency**, and **performance**, Comfor
bridges the gap between industrial robustness and academic flexibility. Whether
you're modeling advanced forming processes or developing custom material
behaviors, Comfor provides a powerful, extensible framework.

# Why Comfor?

## 📚 Built on a Scientific Foundation

Comfor is backed by over a decade of academic and industrial R&D. Our numerical
models are published, peer-reviewed, and validated in collaboration with:

- ENIB [(Brest national school of engineering)](https://www.enib.fr/en_enib/)
- INSA Lyon [(Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon)](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en)
- IRT Jules Verne [(French Institutes of Technology)](https://www.irt-jules-verne.fr/en/irt-jules-verne/)
- UHA [(Université de Haute Alsace)](https://www.uha.fr/en/index.html)

## 🔍 Transparent Physics, From the Ground Up

Forget the black-boxes. Fork the physics. At
[Innovamics](https://www.innovamics.com/), we expose every layer of the
simulation stack—because understanding and trust matter. From material laws to
solvers, you can inspect, audit, and modify:

- Finite element formulations
- Contact and interaction models
- Boundary conditions and constraints
- Time integration schemes
- Plus every component involved in the simulation pipeline

This enables researchers and engineers to:

1. Audit and verify the mathematical models behind simulations
2. Extend or adapt specific aspects of the physics for custom use cases
3. Build trust in simulation results, with full control over assumptions and
   implementations

Our openness fosters a scientific environment where innovation, reproducibility,
and transparency come first.

> We believe open software leads to better science and better engineering.
