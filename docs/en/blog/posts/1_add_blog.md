Weâ€™ve just added a **blog feature** to the **Comfor documentation**!  
The goal is to share updates, tips, and insights about the software in a more dynamic and accessible way.

# Why Add a Blog?

Until now, all information about Comfor was stored in the main documentation.  
With the new blog section, we can now:

- publish **release notes** and version updates,  
- share **quick tips** and short tutorials,    
- present **use cases** and **research projects** involving Comfor.

Thanks for following the project!
