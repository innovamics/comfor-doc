  abstract      = {Modern flat knitting machines using high performance yarns are able to knit fabrics including the reinforcement yarns arranged differently into knit structures. Due to their improved mechanical properties, composites made from multi-layer knit fabrics show great potential in lightweight applications. This paper reports on the development of flat knitted multi-layer textile preforms for high performance thermoplastic composites using hybrid yarns made of glass (GF) and polypropylene (PP) filaments. Such textile preforms with different reinforcements were used to consolidate into 2D thermoplastic composites. Moreover, the mechanical properties of these composites were studied. The mechanical properties of 2D composites were found to be greatly affected by different arrangements of reinforcement yarns. The integration of reinforcement yarns as biaxial inlays (warp and weft yarns) is found to be the best solution for knitting, whereas tuck stitch shaped and unidirectional arranged reinforcements offer also promising application possibilities.},

	Abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced carbon (C/C) composites are candidate materials for plasma facing components in experimental fusion reactors such as: the ITER; the JT-60 {\c C}ƒ{\"I} a Tokamak fusion test facility (JAEA); and for control rods in the next generation fission reactors. Therefore, determining their thermo-mechanical properties under irradiation is essential for safe design-cum-operation of future reactors. Development of reliable models which can predict such materials{\c C}ƒ{\`U} behavior is of massive advantage against the conventional experimental verification which is hugely expensive and time-consuming. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) methods are used here for predicting Young{\c C}ƒ{\`U}s modulus of two woven C/C composites where tensile tests are performed for validation. Stress distribution results indicate that a novel image-based route for FE meshes compared to a unit cell approach gives stronger agreement with experimental data. The image-based approach captures true porosity as fine microstructural details are converted from X-ray tomographic data. In comparison, the unit cell model represents idealizations of composite architecture that ignores porosities.},

	Abstract = {Our latest study presents the theoretical formulation and computer implementation of a three-node six degrees of freedom multilayer flat triangular element intended for the study of the temperature fields in complex multilayer composite shells. Inherent in the formulation, in this first introductory and self-consistent systematic study, are the three modes of heat transfer, namely conduction, convection and radiation, the latter introducing in our theoretical model strong nonlinear effects. In the present discourse, all nonlinear terms are strictly due to radiation; the material properties are assumed independent of temperature but this in no way restricts the generality of the basic theory. The formulation is based on a first-order thermal lamination theory which assumes a linear through-the-thickness temperature variation. The following features are uniquely implemented in the computer model: (1) Exact integration of all matrices including the highly nonlinear radiation matrix (2) Exact integration of all derivative (Jacobian) matrices for efficient nonlinear analysis (3) Geometrical generality achieved by an arbitrarily oriented inexpensive flat shell element (4) Compatibility with structural elements (5) Computational efficiency and simplicity A predictor-corrector scheme in the form of the Newton-Raphson method is adopted for the solution of the steady-state nonlinear problem. Numerical examples, ranging from simple panels to complex anisotropic shells substantiate the theoretical formulation and show the potential of the present laminated triangular element in the computer simulation of temperature effects in complex geometries.},

  abstract      = {A general and systematic approach for the development of mesostructurally-based continuum model of woven fabrics has been elaborated, relating the fabric behavior at the macroscopic continuum scale to the response and geometry of the fabric‚{\"A}{\^o}s mesostructure (geometrical configuration of the weave and the yarn properties). Mesoscopic discrete models of dry fabric have been developed based on a discretization of the yarn geometry, accounting for the yarn‚{\"A}{\`\i}yarn interactions at the yarns crossing points. The yarns are modeled within a unit cell consisting of the repetitive fabric pattern as curved planar beams submitted to the reaction forces of the transverse yarns at discrete crossover points. Those reaction forces are expressed in semi-analytical form versus the yarn geometry and mechanical properties for general armour from beam theory. The equilibrium shape of the woven fabric is obtained by minimizing its total potential energy, accounting for the work of the reaction forces due to the transverse yarns. The absolute minimum of the structure‚{\"A}{\^o}s total potential energy is achieved by a classical genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that plain weave presents a nonlinear response in the early deformation stage due to the crimp change, whereas twill shows a quasi linear response due to yarn extension being the dominant deformation mechanism. Plain weave fabric overall exhibits an orthotropic constitutive law, as biaxial simulations show. The transverse behavior of plain weave fabric is presently evaluated in terms of Poisson‚{\"A}{\^o}s ratio, based on virtual simulations at the mesoscopic scale of analysis. Simulation results show that Poisson‚{\"A}{\^o}s ratio first increases towards a maximum due to the rapid shrinkage of the sample in the transverse direction, and decreases thereafter when the crimp changes become limited by the reaction forces of the transverse yarns. The influence of the mechanical properties of both warp and weft on Poisson‚{\"A}{\^o}s coefficient is assessed. The predictions of the mesoscopic models regarding the impact of yarn geometry and mechanical properties on the overall behavior provide a guideline for the design of woven fabrics.},

Composite materials are material systems that consist of a discrete constituent distributed in a continuous phase and that derive their distinguishing characteristics from the properties and behavior of their constituents, from the geometry and arrangement of the constituents, and from the properties of the interfaces between the constituents. They are classified either on the basis of the nature of the continuous phase (that is, polymer-matrix, metal-matrix, ceramic-matrix, and intermetallic-matrix) or on the basis of the nature of the reinforcing phase (that is, particle reinforced, fiber reinforced, dispersion strengthened, and laminated). The chapter describes various properties of composite materials. These properties can be tailored, and new combinations of properties can be achieved. It is desirable to achieve a certain minimum level of reinforcement content in a composite. Long, continuous fibers with a large aspect ratio of metals, ceramics, glasses and polymers are used to reinforce various types of matrices.},

	Abstract = {The preforming stage of the RTM composite manufacturing process leads to fibrous reinforcement deformations which may be very large especially for double curvature shapes. The knowledge of the mesoscopic deformed geometry is important for reinforcement permeability computations and for damage prediction analyses of the composite. A simulation method for woven composite fabric deformation at mesoscopic scale is presented in this paper. A specific continuum hypo-elastic constitutive model is proposed for the yarn behavior. The associated objective derivative is based on the fiber rotation. Spherical and deviatoric parts of the transverse behavior are uncoupled. X-ray tomography is used to obtain experimental undeformed and deformed 3D geometries of the textile reinforcements. It provides, in particular, fiber distribution within the yarn. A comparison between deformed geometries obtained by mesoscopic simulation and by tomography is presented for biaxial tension and in-plane shear deformation.},

  abstract      = {Lattice models employing trusses and beams are suitable to investigate the mechanical behavior of woven fabrics. The discrete features of the mesostructures of woven fabrics are naturally incorporated by the discrete elements of lattice models. In this paper, a lattice model for woven materials is adopted which consists of a network of trusses in warp and weft direction, which represent the response of the yarns. Additional diagonal trusses are included that provide a resistance against relative rotation of the yarns. The parameters of these families of discrete elements can be separately identified from tensile experiments in three in-plane directions which correspond with the orientations of the discrete elements. The lattice model and the identification approach are applied to electronic textile. This is a fabric in which conductive wires are incorporated to allow the embedment of electronic components such as light-emitting diodes. The model parameters are established based on tensile tests on samples of the electronic textile. A comparison between the experimental results of an out-of-plane punch test and the simulation results shows that the lattice model and its characterization procedure are accurate until extensive biaxial tensile deformation occurs.},

It has excellent coarse mesh accuracy for linear elastic bending, and is easily incorporated into a nonlinear program. The assumed strain field is also used with four-point integration which does not require stabilization. In addition, two forms of the B-matrix are studied and it is shown that the mean form is more efficient since it passes the patch test in a simplified form.},

	Abstract = {Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) is a composite material manufacturing process during which resin is injected into a mold cavity filled with a fibrous reinforcing preform. Application of woven and stitched fiber mats in fabricating preforms for RTM is a highly viable means of manufacturing affordable composites. Draping and in this paper and refers to the act of bringing a flat workpiece into contact with an arbitrary tool surface. As a result and the draping of woven and stitched mats tends to cause the mat to deform to the tool geometry. This paper details an experimental study designed to demonstrate the effect of draping preforms on mold filling and and final structure of the composite product. A mold was built providing a conical mold cavity. Plow visualization experiments were performed and as well as shearing angle and preform fiber volume fraction measurements from manufactured cone parts. Experimental results show that draping does significantly change fiber orientation and fiber volume fraction and permeability and hence the injection pressure or flow rate required to fill a mold. This data was compared with numerical prediction codes for preform deformation and permeability calculation and and mold filling. Preform deformation predictions were found to overpredict in areas of high deformation and due to the assumptions made by the numerical algorithm used. Permeability components calculated are reasonable and but are affected by overpredicted preform deformation and and interpolation methods used. Prediction of injection pressure and flow rate histories are good and while predicted flow front shapes fail to capture some experimental features. Difficulties in predicting flow front shapes are attributed to three mechanisms; a decrease in permeability magnitudes due to increased volume fraction and a smaller volume of fluid required due to increased volume fraction and and reorientation of fiber tows changing the direction of principle permeability components.},

Our objective is to establish the link between some of the main parameters governing the braiding process and the mechanical properties of layer-to-layer interlock 3D braided composites. We first deal with the microstructure of the composite. We distinguish an initial virtual state of the microstructure assuming that the reinforcing yarns show a non-deformed cross-section and that their path depends only on the motion of the bobbins carriers on the braiding plate. A final {\"e}{\"e}realistic{\'\i}{\'\i} state of the microstructure is determined by taking into account the yarns interactions and the consolidation process assuming a known thickness of the composite. Based on the microstructure geometry and mosaic-type models are developed assuming that the textile microstructure can be mapped into a 3D grid of homogenized elements models. Reuss and Voigt bounds and a last model based on Aboudi{\'\i}s method of cells are used in order to evaluate the effect of the process parameters on stiffness and strength terms.},

In this paper and macroscopic forming simulations of woven composite reinforcements are performed using finite elements composed of woven cells and the mechanical behaviour of which are computed by F.E. analyses at mesoscale i.e. on the unit cell of the fabric. The objective is to only calculate the relevant quantities in the woven finite element. The in-plane biaxiale tensile behaviour and the in-plane shear behaviour are obtained by 3D analyses of the woven cell submitted respectively to tension and shear. They need to take the specificities of the mechanical behaviour of the yarn (made of thousand of fibres) into account. Especially an objective derivative based on the fibre rotation is used. These computations on the unit woven cell have proved to be consistent with experimental tests. An example of deep drawing of a square box using the proposed approach is presented. Angles between warp and weft directions are computed as well as wrinkles.},

The constitutive model for a single thread in tension is based on a statistical approach and is identified using tensile tests. Shear and tensile tests have been carried out on fabric specimens to demonstrate that the behavior of the fabric mainly results from the contribution of each thread and the sliding between fiber threads having a small effect on the energy for the deformation mechanism of these fabrics. A numerical model for the shaping process is obtained based on a finite element approach using three- and four-node membrane shell elements. The formulation accounts for the large displacements and large strains involved in the process as well as the mechanical behavior.

The principal stiffness of the fabric is the tensile rigidity. Because of the weaving and the tensile behaviour is non-linear. It is analysed by biaxial tensile tests and 3D finite element computations of the woven unit cells. The in plane shear rigidity of fabrics is very weak up to a limit angle. In this first stage and it is shown by optical measures that the yarns are subjected to rigid rotations. A second stage in which the yarns are laterally crushed leads to larger stiffness. A first simplified form of the dynamic equation is based only on tensile internal virtual work. A second one takes also shear internal work into account. A fabric square box forming simulation is performed with both approaches. It shows the importance to account for shear when the limit shear angle is exceeded.},

The simulation is made within an explicit dynamic approach and is based on a simplified dynamic equation accounting for tension and in-plane shear strain energy. The biaxial tensile properties (given by two surfaces) and the in-plane shear properties (given by a curve) can be determined both by biaxial tensile tests and picture frame experiments or obtained by mesoscopic 3D finite element analyses of the woven unit cell. The interior load components of the proposed finite element are calculated explicitly and simply from the tensions and shear torque on four woven cells. The results obtained by the simulations of a hemispherical forming process on a very unbalanced fabric are compared to experiments. It is shown that the tension strain energy permits to describe the asymmetry of the response but that the computation of wrinkles and of the deformed states when the locking angle is exceeded needs to take the in-plane shear stiffness and its evolution with shear angle into account.},

	Abstract = {An 8-noded linear hexahedron element for large strain hyperelastic analysis is presented in this paper. The element is based on a constant deformation gradient interpolation and is formulated using a mixed variational principle of the Hu{\~n}Washizu type. Volumetric and isochoric components of the deformation are treated independently to ensure the correct evaluation of the element volume. A simple procedure to control the propagation of spurious hourglass deformation modes is also discussed. This is based on the addition of artificial hourglass forces which vanish under constant deformation gradient conditions, thereby ensuring that the element passes a non-linear version of the patch test. Applications in the field of neo-Hookean materials and superplastic forming processes are also considered.},

Tension versus deformation curves and for different strain ratios and are obtained in the case of composite woven reinforcements used in aeronautic applications. It is shown that the tensile behavior of the fabric is strongly nonlinear due to the weaving undulations and the yarn contraction and and that the phenomenon is clearly biaxial.

  abstract      = {A hyperelastic constitutive law is proposed to describe the mechanical behaviour of 3D layer to layer angle interlock composite reinforcements. The objective of this model is to simulate shaping of thick textile preforms for RTM processes. After the identification of the independent deformation modes of initially orthotropic reinforcements, a strain energy potential is built up based on strain invariants representative to those modes assuming an additive composition of them. The parameters of the proposed constitutive model are identified using standard and specific mechanical tests performed on a 3D interlock material. Then, the model is validated on forming simulations on a single curve and double curve shapes. Three point bending tests on thick interlock reinforcements have been analysed experimentally and numerically. The specific transformation of cross sections is depicted by the proposed hyperelastic model. ¬{\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

On the basis of this model and beam theory in the mechanics of materials and analytical expressions for relations among the fiber volume fraction and the applied compressive force and the preform thickness reduction have been established.

Microscopic evidence of the microstructure of preforms reveals the dfferent configurations of the yarns in the interior and surface and corner regions of a braided preform. On the basis of microscopic observations and three types of microstructural unit cell models are established for the three regions. By using these three unit cell models and the structural geometry of the preforms is analyzed and the mathematical relationships among the structural parameters and such as the yarn packing factor and fiber orientation and fiber volume fraction and braiding pitch and are derived. From the preforms to the final composites and if the RTM process is utilized and the unit cell size and shape will be changed. The modification of the relationships among the structural parameters has been made. Good agreement has been obtained between the calculated and measured values of the geometric characteristics of braided composite samples.},

Many different approaches and algorithms for mesh simplification have been proposed in the last few years. We present a survey and a characterization of the fundamental methods. Moreover, the results of an empirical comparison of the simplification codes available in the public domain are discussed. Five implementations, chosen to give a wide spectrum of different topology preserving methods, were run on a set of sample surfaces.

  abstract      = {Observations of failure mechanisms in monotonic loading are reported for graphite/epoxy composites containing three-dimensional (3D) interlock weave reinforcement. The key phenomena are delamination and kink band formation in compression, tow rupture and pullout in tension, and combinations of these in bending. The materials exhibit great potential for damage tolerance and notch insensitivity. This is partly due to the presence of geometrical flaws that are broadly distributed in strength and space; and partly to the coarseness of the reinforcing tows, which leads to extensive debonding and reduced stress intensification around sites of failure. Rules of mixture corrected for the effects of tow irregularity suffice to estimate elastic moduli. Rough estimates of the stress at which the first failure events occur in compression or tension can be made from existing micromechanical models. Ultimate tensile failure might be modeled by regarding failed tows that are being pulled out of the composite as a cohesive zone. The characteristic length estimated for this zone, which is a direct measure of damage tolerance and notch insensitivity, has very large values of order of magnitude 0.1‚{\"A}{\`\i}0.5 m.},

  abstract      = {One of the most outstanding features of plastics is the ease with which they can be processed. In some cases semi-finished articles such as sheets or rods are produced and subsequently fabricated into shape using conventional methods such as welding or machining. In the majority of cases, however, the finished article, which may be quite complex in shape, is produced in a single operation. The processing stages of heating, shaping and cooling may be continuous (eg production of pipe by extrusion) or a repeated cycle of events (eg production of a telephone housing by injection moulding) but in most cases the processes may be automated and so are particularly suitable for mass production. There is a wide range of processing methods which may be used for plastics. In most cases the choice of method is based on the shape of the component and whether it is thermoplastic or thermosetting. It is important therefore that throughout the design process, the designer must have a basic understanding of the range of processing methods for plastics since an ill-conceived shape or design detail may limit the choice of moulding methods.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents effective thermo-mechanical and thermal properties of plain-weave fabric-reinforced composite laminates obtained from micromechanical analyses and a two-scale asymptotic homogenization theory. A unit cell, enclosing the characteristic periodic repeat pattern in the fabric weave, is isolated and modeled. The orthotropic tensors for effective mechanical stiffness, coefficient of thermal expansion and thermal conductivity are obtained by numerically solving appropriate microscale boundary value problems (BVPs) in the unit cell by the use of three-dimensional finite element analyses. Further, analytical models consisting of series-parallel thermal resistance networks are developed in order, to obtain orthotropic thermal conductivity. The numerical and analytical models are explicitly based on the properties of the constituent materials and three-dimensional features of the weave style. Results obtained from the models are compared with experimental values and with models available in the literature. Non-linear mechanical constitutive behavior due to resin stress/strain non-linearity and to transverse yarn damage under in-plane uni-axial loads are also investigated. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the effect of varying fiber volume fractions on the effective thermal properties.},

  abstract      = {Materials for consideration and use in automotive body structures The wide range of materials that may be considered for the construction of the automobile body is first evaluated with respect to their relevant mechanical and physical properties. Then, the rationale for the selection of key materials, referred to in Chapter 2, is explored, extending the list of necessary attributes to include those relating to production and service. For each of these materials, a quantitative assessment for each criterion, with relative ratings, is given. Not only are the mechanical properties compared, important from an engineering viewpoint, but ratings are also given for cost, manufacturability, recyclability and reparability. Allowance must be made for the category of vehicle being considered, e.g. volume, prestige or performance model. Overall this approach provides a useful comparison not presented previously. Importantly, the production processes relevant to the key materials are covered, giving an insight into the versatility and limitations of each, and providing useful background knowledge for issues relating to suppliers. Detailed information is given on the latest grades of the ever-growing family of high-strength steels, together with the aluminum alloys, magnesium and composites now in use. As well as inherent properties, factors such as surface technology, affecting both processing and cosmetic finish, are considered. Reparability is another attribute that assumes greater importance as complexity of materials and hybridization of body panel combinations, as well as insurance cost, increase. This is now accorded a separate section.},

	Abstract = {In the present work and we explore the potential of X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray micro CT) to characterize the microstructural variation of four different 3D warp-interlaced fabrics. The accuracy of the technique was determined quantitatively by comparing measured values of yarn thickness and width and spacing between the yarns from X-ray micro CT images with measurements obtained from optical micrographs of the same textile. This comparison indicates that the difference between the two techniques is not statistically significant and lending credence to X-ray micro CT as a means to acquire input for models of textiles and textile composites. Micro-structural variation in a given fabric was found to be quite large (standard deviation of the geometrical parameters up to 16%). A comparison of similar yarns in different directions and fabrics also resulted in large variations. Variability of the fabric parameters is implemented in a {\"e}{\"e}virtual textile{\'\i}{\'\i} model of 3D fabrics. The influence of the variability of the fabric internal geometry on the mechanical properties of the composite is estimated using a micro-mechanical model.},

	Abstract = {MicroCT scanning is a non-destructive method which was used to visualise tow architecture in woven composites, with the ultimate goal of three-dimensional model generation. It is difficult to discriminate between elements of carbon-fibre composites using MicroCT, particularly the region between co-aligned neighbouring tows. Methods used to facilitate visualisation by enhancing contrast during scanning were discussed in part one [Djukic LP, Herszberg I, Walsh WR, Schoeppner GA, Prusty BG, Kelly DW. Contrast enhancement in visualisation of woven composite tow architecture using a MicroCT Scanner. Part 1: fabric coating and resin additives. Compos Part A 2009;40:553{\c C}ƒ{\"I}65.]. In order to improve upon these methods, tows were coated in a material of higher density and subsequently woven into a fabric. The most successful coatings were found to be gold and iodine. Adequate visualisations of glass tows were possible without contrast enhancement. These methods can be combined to allow multiple levels of contrast within a sample, as demonstrated with a three-dimensional woven preform. Three-dimensional reconstructions of interior tow architectures were made from the scans of contrast enhanced specimens.},

The evaluation of the properties is done by sampling the component at known positions. The samples (of size of 1 mm3) are scanned in a tomograph which yields 3-D images. We are interested in extracting the individual fibres, to analyze their length and local orientation.

The segmentation of the fibres is a challenging task. First, the resolution of the reconstruction being at the limits of the capabilities of the device (optics, sensor, wavelength), the images are noisy and fuzzy. Second, the fibres have a non uniform length and are heavily tangled. This paper describes the segmentation process.},

	Abstract = {A 2.5D laminated carbon{\c C}ƒ{\"I}carbon composite was studied in the present work. Measurements of density were made by a non-contact and non-destructive method: X-ray tomography. The experimental procedure and artefact correction are described in detail in this paper. The mechanical characterisation was made by tensile, compression, and torsional tests. The role of oxidation on mechanical properties for all these stress states was estimated. The link between the mechanical properties and the changes induced by oxidation of the material density was established. Overall, oxidation leads to a reduction of the initial moduli. This work shows also that X-ray tomography is a good tool for measuring, by a non-destructive method, the material density over a given volume. Potentially, the results obtained by destructive mechanical tests on laboratory specimens and by non-destructive X-ray tomography techniques on large scale parts can be put together in order to estimate, in a non-destructive way, the mechanical properties in some locations of that part.},

	Abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of a woven structure remains poorly understood because of the material{\'\i}s anisotropic behaviour. This leads to the challenging task of performing a reliable and repeatable investigation for the characterisation of the material properties. Shear properties of the woven fabric are assessed by bias extension and picture frame tests. The aim of the present work is to analyse the shear deformation in plain cotton fabric during bias extension and picture frame tests using digital image correlation. The latter allows direct and local measurement that does not require a numerical or analytical model. Using this optical method, the homogeneity of deformation is studied and the experimental strain is compared to that predicted by theory.},

	Abstract = {For composite materials with complex reinforcing structures and such as knitted fabrics and a material model must be able to accommodate the most important parameters so that the material can be simulated accurately. Sometimes these important parameters can be found by examining the reinforcing structure alone. To investigate these parameters physically would be very difficult because of the scale and level of detail required; however and using advanced numerical micro-simulations a large quantity of information can be made available. By numerically simulating the tensile test of a knitted specimen the most important parts of the textile structure{\'\i}s deformation behaviour can be identified. In this study a numerical micro-specimen has been developed by simulating the actual fabric manufacture and so that the force-determined geometry and residual stresses incurred during the manufacturing process are captured. The two-step modelling procedure is performed using a dynamic explicit finite element code. Each filament is represented by a series of rigidly connected beam elements and which undergo a complex set of contact interactions. To validate the model and numerical simulations of the warp direction load versus extension is compared with the experimental data. It has been proposed that eight individual deformation modes exist for textile materials in general. For different reinforcing fabrics the influence of each of these mechanisms during fabric deformation is different; however and the definition of a generalised model allows user inputs for these parameters. These input data can be obtained by taking numerical measurements from the micro-specimen model and which is in itself and capable of producing different knitted structures by adjusting the boundary conditions that represent elements of the knitting machinery.},

The details and capabilities of the model are discussed and comparisons are made with real fibre angle measurements taken from dry fabric hemispherical dome and three dimensional test shape forming experiments, under the influence of different stitch patterns. The current model demonstrates a high level of functionality allowing accurate prediction of yarn and stitch pattern movement as well as stresses and strains.

	Abstract = {A general approach to the mechanical behaviour of woven fabrics at the scale of individual fibers is proposed in this paper. In order to simulate the behaviour of samples of woven fabrics and all fibers constituting these samples are taken into account in the model and and particular attention is paid to detecting and modeling of contact-friction interactions occuring within the assembly of fibers. The global problem is set within a large deformation framework and and is solved using an implicit algorithm. The developed methods are first employed to compute the unknown initial configuration of woven structures by reproducing the arrangement of yarns generated by the weaving process. Various loading cases can then be applied in order to identify the mechanical properties of such materials. Numerical results about samples made of nearly 400 fibers are given to show the ability of the method to handle representative examples. Very useful informations at the scale of individual fibers are obtained from these simulations and should help to understand the mechanisms at microscopic scale governing the complex nonlinear behaviour of woven fabrics.},

Because of this, a failure criterion for prediction of failure caused by kinking under multiaxial (axial compression and shear) loading has been adapted to a \{NCF\} composite system. The criterion has been validated for compression tests of quasi-isotropic laminates tested in uniaxial compression. By performing compression tests of the laminate at different off-axis angles, it was possible to vary the ratio of compressive axial stress/shear stress in the specimens. The test results proved that the criterion works well for predictions of kinking governed failure for the present material system. Detailed fractographic studies confirmed that formation of kink bands was the mechanism responsible for specimen failure. Kink bands were also found to develop at loads significantly lower than load at specimen failure.},

	Abstract = {Non-crimp fabric (NCF) composites and manufactured by resin infusion techniques are one of the most promising next generation composite materials. They offer large potential for application in primary structures as they give excellent performance at low production costs. However and before NCF composites will be efficiently used in design and detailed understanding of governing micro mechanisms must be accumulated and described by predictive models. In the present study and NCF cross-ply laminates have been tested in tension. Intralaminar cracks caused in the 90∞ fibre bundle layers and their effect on laminate mechanical properties have been monitored. Occurrence of {\"e}novel{\'\i} type of cracks propagating in the load direction (longitudinal cracks) is explained by a thorough FE analysis using an Representative Volume Element (RVE) approach and revealing stress concentrations caused by 0∞ fibre bundle waviness. Effects of damage on mechanical properties are modelled using modified micro mechanical models developed for analysis of conventional laminated composites. The analysis reveals mechanical degradation to be ruled by the crack opening displacement (COD). However and unlike traditional composites and transverse cracks do not generally extend through the entire thickness of the 90∞ layer and but are rather contained in single fibre bundles and limiting the COD.},

	Abstract = {The study of cerebral microvascular networks requires high-resolution images. However, to obtain statistically relevant results, a large area of the brain (several square millimeters) must be analyzed. This leads us to consider huge images, too large to be loaded and processed at once in the memory of a standard computer. To consider a large area, a compact representation of the vessels is required. The medial axis is the preferred tool for this application. To extract it, a dedicated skeletonization algorithm is proposed. Numerous approaches already exist which focus on computational efficiency. However, they all implicitly assume that the image can be completely processed in the computer memory, which is not realistic with the large images considered here. We present in this paper a skeletonization algorithm that processes data locally (in subimages) while preserving global properties (i.e., homotopy). We then show some results obtained on a mosaic of three-dimensional images acquired by confocal microscopy.},

The aim of this study is to recall the specificity of the mechanical behaviour of dry fabrics and to understand the local phenomena that influence the macroscopic behaviour. For this and 3D finite element analyses of elementary patterns are performed. These calculations are not classical due to the constitution of the yarns made of a lot of small fibres. The possible motions of the yarns allow changes of undulation leading to nonlinear biaxial tensile behaviour and the lack of most of the other stiffnesses. The specificities of the calculation in order to reach this behaviour are described. The model is compared to biaxial tests on several fabrics. Such a model allows to understand the phenomena implicated in the behaviour and the main aspects that lead to the specific behaviour of woven media. It can also bring a help for the design of new fabrics in changing some mechanical and geometrical parameters in order to get prescribed properties.},

A numerical tool for the simulation of this shaping process is proposed. The aim of the software developed is to be able to determine if a drawing operation is possible before the manufacturing of expensive tools. The approach used is a mechanical one. The behaviour of the flat fabrics used in the shaping process is obtained from the tensile curve of a single yarn and the current position of yarns during the shaping operation. Discrete finite elements made of yarns are used and which lead to a good numerical eficiency and especially in the case of elements directed by the yarns. A set of comparisons between shaping simulations and experimental results proves the validity of the proposed formulation.},

	Abstract = {Preforming is an important step in the manufacturing of textile-reinforced composites with resin infusion processes. It is important to control the fiber orientation to avoid fiber misalignments and wrinkles, which would reduce the mechanical properties of the composite part. The objective of the present paper is to give an overview of the literature dedicated to the textile reinforcement forming process. Therefore, experimental tests for the determination of the basic fabric properties, the experimental characterization of the forming and the numerical approaches for the modeling of the textile forming are reviewed. A great part of the literature has been devoted to the characterization of the shear behavior since it is the most important property for textile reinforcement forming processes. The bending behavior was initially neglected in mechanical models but was found to be important for the simulation of wrinkles. ¬{\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The effects of processing parameters on the friction coefficient between commingled glass{\~n}polypropylene plain-weave fabric composites (Twintex) and the steel tool during thermostamping processes were investigated. The investigation focused on the effects of fabric velocity and normal force and resin viscosity under conditions similar to those in thermostamping processes. The effect of resin viscosity on the resulting friction coefficient was evaluated through changes in tool temperature and initial fabric temperature. The results from these experiments could be related to trends predicted by Stribeck-curve theory. Based on the effects of those parameters and the Stribeckcurve theory and an empirical friction model was developed and incorporated into ABAQUS as a user-defined friction subroutine. This paper describes the development of that friction model for use in finite element models of the thermostamping process. It also discusses the results of a parametric study conducted using the friction model with a finite element model of the thermostamping process. These results show the importance of properly accounting for changes in friction at the metal{\~n}fabric interface in numerical simulations of the thermostamping process.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In order to accurately predict the performance of 3D woven composites, it is necessary that realistic textile geometry is considered, since failure typically initiates at regions of high deformation or resin pockets. This paper presents the development of a finite element model based on the multi-chain digital element technique, as applied to simulate weaving and compaction of an orthogonal 3D woven composite. The model was reduced to the scale of the unit cell facilitating high fidelity results combined with relatively fast analysis times. The results of these simulations are compared with micro computed tomography (CT) scans of a dry specimen of fabric subjected to in situ compaction. The model accurately depicted all of the key features of the fabric including yarn waviness and cross-sectional shapes as well as their development with compaction. A parametric study is presented to characterise the effect of the model inputs on the analysis speed and accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Continuous and discrete approaches for forming simulations of textile performs both involve difficulties and drawbacks. The semidiscrete method is an alternative based on a meso-macro approach. It is based on specific finite elements made of a discrete number of the components of the textile at lower scale. Their strain energy in the interpolated displacement field leads to the nodal interior loads of the element. In this paper a new three node element is proposed. It is made up of warp and weft fibres and the tensile and in plane shear energy of which are considered. The directions of the warp and weft yarns are arbitrary with regard to the element sides. That is very important in case of simultaneous multiply draping simulations and when using remeshing. The determination of the material data necessary to the simulation from standard tensile and bias tests is straightforward. A set of elementary tests and mono and multi-ply draping shows the efficiency of the approach.},

	Abstract = {In this study and a FEM analysis has been carried out to find out pertinent multi-scale model for an investigation of a ballistic impact on 2D KM2 plain-woven fabrics. Multi-scale models are a combination between macroscopic and mesoscopic models. This study aims at testing a multi-scale model in order to minimize the computing time. Three configurations were analyzed by varying the ratio of macroscopic and mesoscopic areas: 75.3{\~n}24.7% and 65.5{\~n}34.5% and 56.3{\~n}43.7% with two impact velocities 60 m/s and 245 m/s. In these multi-scale models and the continuity in macroscopic{\~n}mesoscopic interfaces is ensured by checking the evolution of global displacements of the fabric during impact. The effect of the macroscopic area of multi-scale models on the ballistic performance of the fabric is also investigated. The optimal multi-scale model was validated by comparison with results obtained from a mesoscopic model in terms of the evolutions of the projectile velocity and energy forms and the overall behavior of the fabric during impact and the force applied on the projectile. The failure criterion Forming Limited Diagram (FLD) is suggested for bundle failure. The observed damage mechanisms of the fabric during penetration time of the projectile are discussed and compared among numerical models.},

	Abstract = {An investigation of the testing methods employed in characterising the forming of woven composite materials has been performed. An energy argument is presented that shows that picture frame results should be normalised with respect to a characteristic length rather than area. A novel normalisation procedure for bias extension testing is proposed that allows direct comparison of bias extension and picture frame results. The investigation illustrates how bias extension and picture frame tests can be used together to perform reliable characterisation of a given material. Furthermore and a convenient method of determining a material's locking angle using bias extension testing is outlined. Two different materials have been considered in the investigation and a 5-harness satin woven carbon/epoxy prepreg composite and a 2x2 twill woven glass/polypropylene thermoplastic composite. The suitability of the normalisation procedure with respect to each of these materials is discussed and the relative merits of each testing method are compared.},

	Abstract = {In this study, a constitutive model to predict shear force versus shear angle for a viscous textile composite sheet is developed, based on fibre volume fraction, textile architecture and matrix rheology. The model is evaluated using results obtained for a pre-consolidated 2??2 twill weave glass/polypropylene thermoplastic textile composite and a 5-harness satin weave carbon/epoxy thermoset prepreg. The model is based on an adaptation of uniaxial continuum theory for continuous fibre-reinforced composites. Meso- and micro-kinematics of deformation are considered in determining contributions to energy dissipation during shear. Contributions from a number of sources are included, representing shearing of the matrix between and within tows and also at tow crossovers. The model can represent the effects on shear resistance due to forming conditions (temperature and rate) through incorporation of the matrix rheology. As this is fundamentally a predictive modelling approach, it should facilitate the improved design of materials and optimisation of component manufacture. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results from picture frame tests are presented, which indicate the behavioural response of these materials to shear deformation, when varying parameters such as temperature and shear rate. Observations are then presented illustrating how intraply shear deformation can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous on a mesoscopic scale, depending on the test's boundary conditions. Two distinct modes of deformation are identified and explained by consideration of simple shear kinematics within the ply. The mode of deformation is shown to influence dramatically the velocity field between crossovers in woven fabrics and a qualitative argument is presented to suggest that the contribution to the total deformation energy from crossovers is negligible. Implications of these different modes of deformation on the forming of three-dimensional components are analysed.},

	Abstract = {The theories of Hasselman et al. and Benveniste et al. were extended to derive expressions for the longitudinal and transverse effective thermal conductivity of an isotropic matrix uniaxially reinforced with dilute concentrations of cylindrically orthotro pic fibers for finite interfacial thermal conductance values. The transverse thermal conduc tivity of the composite was found to be a function of both the radial and tangential compo nents of the transverse thermal conductivity of the fibers. Comparison with the effective thermal conductivity of an isotropic matrix reinforced with isotropic fibers indicates the effective thermal conductivity of cylindrically orthotropic fibers equals the geometric mean of the radial and tangential transverse thermal conductivity. As for isotropic matrices reinforced with isotropic fibers, a finite value for the interfacial thermal conductance in composites reinforced with cylindrically orthotropic fibers leads to a lowering of the com posite transverse thermal conductivity and also introduces a dependence on fiber diameter. Based on experimental data for the transverse thermal conductivity of a uniaxial carbon fiber-reinforced aluminoborosilicate glass matrix composite in nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and in vacuum, estimates of the interfacial thermal conductances indicate that in nitrogen at atmospheric pressure interfacial gaseous heat transfer contributes about one- third of the total interfacial thermal conductance. The theory should be applicable to other isotropic matrices reinforced with cylindrically orthotropic fibers.},

Nonlinear material behavior is incorporated through nonlocal continuum damage mechanics that preserves mesh objectivity in calculations that go beyond maximum loads. The integrated model is applied to the curing of plain weave textile composites made from carbon fiber tows and Epon ‚{\~N}¢ 862 resin. The mechanical and chemical properties are measured during curing using concurrent Brillouin and Raman light scattering. It is shown that significant stresses can develop during cure. The effect of these stresses on the manufactured part performance, when subsequent service loads are applied, is evaluated and a reduction in ultimate load, in agreement with experimental observations, is observed.},

On the other hand, the in-plane stiffness and strength properties of the laminate may be reduced by this process though the induction of in-plane fibre undulations and the formation of voids in the vicinity of stitches after resin infusion. In this chapter the effect of structural stitching on in-plane and out-of-plane properties of multidirectional non-crimp fabric (NCF) carbon fibre/epoxy laminates is illustrated. Ambivalent effects of the various stitching parameters on the mechanical properties were observed. A finite element based unit cell model was developed to estimate in-plane elasticity and strength coefficients of structurally stitched \{NCF\} laminates. Comparison with experimental results shows that stiffness and strength properties of structurally stitched \{NCF\} laminates can be predicted with satisfying accuracy.},

  abstract      = {The knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of woven composite reinforcements is necessary to analyse and simulate the forming processes of these composites. Tensile rigidities of fabrics are large compared to others and they mainly drive the deformation. The tensile behaviour of woven reinforcements is specific because the undulations due to weaving lead to strong non-linearities at the beginning of the loading. These undulations in both directions lead to a biaxial phenomenon. In the present paper, a simplified biaxial tensile model gives the tension response for all warp and weft strains with very fast computations. It can be used to carry out optimization of the parameters of the woven reinforcement. This model is based on a consistent description of the fabric geometry. Contrary to most others models it strictly avoids spurious voids and interpenetrations of the yarns due to geometrical assumptions. The geometrical model remains nevertheless simple and requires three or six dimensional parameters according to whether the fabric is balanced or not. The simplified mechanical model based on this geometrical description is a truss type model. From the local equilibrium equations of woven yarns, it relates the tensions in the warp and weft directions to the axial strains in these two directions. The tensile surfaces are obtained very quickly and are in good agreement with results of experimental biaxial tests.},

	Abstract = {Many different methods can be used to obtain a composite part. Among them and several require the forming of a dry fabric before the resin is injected. The mechanical properties of the obtained part depend to a large extent on the mechanical behavior of the dry fabric. Experimental methods are efficient to identify this behavior and but they need to be complemented with numerical approaches. Among the numerical approaches and 3D finite element simulation is very interesting but requires an accurate 3D mesh of the fabric elementary cell. In this paper and we are proposing a new consistent 3D geometrical model of 2D fabrics. Experimental observations using different optical processes have been performed in order to determine real yarn geometry in different cases of yarn structure and weaving. The analysis of these results helps us define the accurate generic 3D model of a yarn shape when it is weaved. Using this model of a yarn and a consistent 3D geometrical model of 2D fabrics is presented. One particularity of this model is that it ensures a realistic contact surface between yarns without interpenetration for all types of weaving. The section shape varies along the trajectory and so that the influence of contact between yarns on their cross section shape can be taken into account. This model can be easily identified using three to seven parameters measured on a real fabric. A meshing preprocessor based on this geometrical model is then developed. It substantially reduces the time needed to obtain an accurate hexahedral mesh of the elementary cell of a fabric. This is an important point for the 3D finite element simulation of fabrics and which is a powerful method to investigate their mechanical behavior. Examples of shear and biaxial extension are presented to show the efficiency of the whole simulation chain.},

  abstract      = {One of the components required for design and optimisation of fabric reinforced products is a realistic and accurate 3-D geometry model for a repeating element of the reinforcement. Such a model, which reflects the deformations that result from weaving the fibre bundles and forming (draping) the woven fabric over a product mould, is proposed in the present paper. A fibre bundle architecture, which exhibits undulation and variable cross-section dimensions, is introduced to this effect. Every bundle is described by its in-plane centreline path, its double curved horizontal midplane and the thickness distribution of the cross-sections. These parameters are, in turn, defined by invariant shape functions and variable fibre bundle dimensions. The selected geometry description enables straightforward determination of individual fibre paths. In order to verify the model experimentally, cross-sections are cut out from undeformed laminates with plain-weave reinforcements, and laminates of which the plain-weaves have been subjected to stretching or shear deformations during draping. The laminate cross-sections are made along and perpendicular to the mean directions of the impregnated fibre bundles (yarns). All yarns exhibit out-of-plane undulation, and curvature and twist of the midplane. Correlation between experiment and the proposed modeling scheme is good. Draping results in significant fibre reorientations and variations between the individual fibre paths, which are not reflected by existing modeling schemes. These geometry deviations may significantly affect the stress distribution, and should be taken into account in order to predict material properties accurately.},

Square samples of 100 mm sides were subjected to low-velocity impact loading using an instrumented impact testing machine at three energy levels of 15, 30 and 45 J. Three samples were tested at each energy level. Impact parameters like peak load, time to peak load, deflection at peak load, and absorbed energy were evaluated and compared for different types of laminates. Failure modes were studied by sectioning the samples and observing under optical microscope.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a numerical methodology to simulate and design the composite thermoforming process. First, in the process simulation, the FEM modeling including flow, heat transfer and residual stress is developed to analyze the thermoforming process of composite laminates with woven fabric microstructures. The governing equations and material properties of thermoplastic composites at the forming temperature are obtained by the homogenization method based on the assumption of instantaneously rigid solid fibers suspended in a viscous non-Newtonian polymer melt. The processing theology of the composites is characterized by a power-law constitutive model for this non-isothermal and shear thinning fluid. To simulate the shaping and cooling stages of the entire forming process, the three-dimensional finite element method incorporating a fiber orientation model of woven-fabric microstructures is developed. Based on kinematic considerations, the fiber orientation model is used to keep track of the microstructure change due to large deformation. This global--local numerical methodology is capable of predicting macroscopic and microscopic deformation mechanics during processing. Second, in the process optimization, the design objective is to achieve a uniform final thickness distribution by designing the preheated composite temperature field. The finite difference approximation is utilized to evaluate the design sensitivities. Using the FEM developed in the first part as the analysis tool, the optimization scheme can allow process designers to optimally design this process. A number of numerical examples and experimental results are presented to demonstrate this combined analysis and optimization algorithm.},

	Abstract = {In the present paper a new orthotropic hyperelastic constitutive model is proposed which can be applied to the numerical simulation of a wide range of anisotropic materials and particularly biological soft tissues. The model represents a non-linear extension of the orthotropic St. Venant{\~n}Kirchhoff material and is described in each principal material direction by an arbitrary isotropic tensor function coupled with the corresponding structural tensor. In the special case of isotropy this constitutive formulation reduces to the Valanis{\~n}Landel hypothesis and may therefore be considered as its generalization to the case of orthotropy. Constitutive relations and tangent moduli of the model are expressed in terms of eigenvalue bases of the right Cauchy{\~n}Green tensor C and obtained for the case of distinct and coinciding eigenvalues as well. For the analysis of shells the model is then coupled with a six (five in incompressible case) parametric shell kinematics able to deal with large strains as well as finite rotations. The application of the developed finite shell element is finally illustrated by a number of numerical examples.},

The microstructure was simplified by transferring the \{BWK\} composite into an equivalent laminate. Residual velocities of conically cylindrical steel projectiles (Type 56 in China Military Standard) and impact damage of the \{BWK\} composite were calculated with finite element method (FEM) and compared with those in experimental. Good agreements between \{FEM\} and experimental were found. The agreements verify the availability of the simplified model for the ballistic performance prediction of the \{BWK\} composite. We expect such an effort could be extended to the design of the \{BWK\} composites in field of aircrafts, high speed vehicles and ballistic protections.},

	Abstract = {The design of textile composites requires a systematic approach that integrates microstructural design and preform fabrication and composite processing to produce load-bearing structural components with desired fiber architectures and mechanical properties. At the present time and an established integrated approach has yet to be realized; however and towards this end and a substantial body of research has been conducted. The purpose of this review is to detail the progress made toward realizing an integrated approach in the design and manufacture of three-dimensional textile preforms. The survey begins by identifying the recent advances in textile manufacturing with particular attention paid to new developments in multi-axial weaving and multi-axial warp knitting and stitching and braiding along with their potential advantages and limitations. A summary of the various preform manufacturing techniques corresponding to the basic load-bearing structural elements is then given. Additionally and limited examples demonstrating the geometric constraints inherent with these techniques and their associated process windows are discussed. Finally and a brief mention of some of the analytical models developed to predict the thermoelastic properties of three-dimensional textile composites is made.},

Potential advantages of using woven fabrics as opposed to cross-ply unidirectional prepreg tapes are specifically discussed from the viewpoint of the microstructure/property relationship. Correlations are established between resistance to and tolerance of impact damage and the delamination resistance of composites. Salient differences are identified between composites made from different fibre configurations in terms of the process of damage development, damage modes/states and residual performance after impact damage. The effects of fibre/matrix interface properties influenced by different silane coupling agents on interlaminar fracture and the impact performance of woven-glass-fabric composites are evaluated. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper a constitutive model for anisotropic finite strain plasticity, which considers the major effects of the macroscopic behaviour of matrix-fibre materials, is presented. As essential feature matrix and fibres are treated separately, which allows as many bundles of fibres as desired. The free energy function is additively split into a part related to the matrix and in parts corresponding to the fibres. Usually the free energy function is defined by the integrity basis of the main variable and structural tensors, which leads to complicated numerical schemes. Here, the continuum is considered as superimposed of the isotropic matrix and further one-dimensional continua each of them represents one bundle of fibres. The deformation gradient applies to all continua introducing a constraint, which links the different continua. One of the most striking features of the model is its suitability for a numerical treatment.},

	Abstract = {The fundamentals of multi-step" braiding for the fabrication of three-dimensional fibre preforms for composites have been studied. To facilitate the understanding of the complex multi-step braiding processes and a computer simulation algorithm has been developed. The simulation acts as a tool to allow the identification of individual yarn paths and number and location of yarn groups and and braid geometry. It was found that individual control of the rows and columns of yarn carriers on a Cartesian braiding bed allows for the fabrication of advanced "multi-step" braids; the micro-structural possibilities of three-dimensional braids are thus greatly extended. Some basic relationships of the braiding parameters have been identified. It has been concluded that the traditional four-step and two-step braidings are special cases of multi-step braidings. To verify the feasibility of the structures and experimental investigations have also been carried out: Innovative braid architectures have been designed and fabricated using a prototype multi-step braiding machine.},

A weaving set-up for this purpose has been developed. The second objective is to characterize the microstructures of the composites and to assess the merits and limitations associated with the rods. Three types of fabric have been made in this study. The first is a 3-axis orthogonal type combining the rods in the axial direction. The second type has a similar structure except that the rods are also used in the widthwise direction. The third is the addition of two off-axis weaving yarns to the first type and resulting in a 5-axis structure. Material processing involves rod pultrusion and fabric formation and and resin impregnation. Both Kevlar and carbon tows have been used in the rods and weaving yarns. A series of specimens with varying bundle size of the weaving yarns have been made. No pressing force was applied during resin transfer molding to preserve the as-formed fabric configuration. According to the micrographs and the rods are essentially free of distortion and while two kinds of local deformation have been identified in the yarns. Unit cells are selected to describe interior microstructures of the materials. Fiber distribution along each direction and matrix distribution in interbundle and intrabundle spaces have been examined on the basis of measured fabric dimensions. The influence of the pitch length on the distributions of fiber and matrix has been analyzed by assuming constant yarn areas. Unique features in processing/microstructure relationships resulting from the presence of the rods have been discussed.},

  abstract      = {This paper is aimed at elucidating the processing-property relationships of composites through experimental characterization. The fabrication processes involve three primary steps: the pultrusion of 1 mm diameter unidirectional rods, the formation of three-dimensional preforms incorporating the rods, and the impregnation of resin into the preforms. The use of the rods is intended to address crimp problems often seen in textile composites. A modified two-step set-up to incorporate the rods has been developed. A series of fabrics with varying braiding fibers, pitch lengths and braider sizes has been made to investigate their respective influence on processing and damage behavior. In comparison with conventional textile composites, the axial yarns are straight and are packed in a rather dense and orderly manner. The composite moduli have been analysed by using the fabric geometry model and compared with the experimental results. The material characterization has been carried out on the basis of flexure, short-beam and compression tests. Damage configurations and accumulation for each loading case have been examined. Unique features include pull-in and push-out of the rods, which are the dominant modes in the short-beam tests. Buckling of the rods is the major damage in the flexure and compression tests. The buckled rods form kink bands analogous to fiber microbuckling in compressed unidirectional composites. The kink bands were found to propagate along the interlacing loops on the surface. These unique damage characteristics associated with the use of the rods are discussed in detail.},

In the large majority of experimental and simulation analyses and it is assumed that the shear behaviour does not depend on the tensions in the yarns. In particular the picture frame shear test supposes that the yarn tensions are equal to zero or without consequence. In this article and an experimental device is proposed which enables to measure the tensions during a picture frame test. It is shown that initial tensions modify the response in shearing and particularly in the first part of the shear curve. Furthermore and it is also shown that the tension during a picture frame test without initial tension does not remain equal to zero. Finally and when slackening the tension to zero during a picture frame test and the measured shear force noticeably decreases and reaches values close to those obtained by a bias test.},

	Abstract = {Efforts are currently devoted to the development of numerical tools for predicting the forming process of continuous fiberreinforced thermoplastic composites. To ensure good predictions and reliable experimental measurements of the laminate properties must be performed at the processing temperature. This paper presents experimental results of the intraply shear properties measured on a polypropylene/glass fabric using two different methods known as the bias-extension and the picture-frame testing methods. Based on kinematic equations and both methods of measurement are discussed in regards to their respective weaknesses and mainly related to the difficulty to measure precise shear angles in the bias-extension method and the undesired fiber tension invalidating the load-displacement curve in the picture-frame test. To remove these difficulties and a modified version of the picture-frame test is proposed. This new method avoids fiber tensioning during testing and is considered more appropriate to capture the influence of the fabric architecture on the measured properties. Good correlations between the load{\~n}displacement curves and viscosities measured with the modified picture-frame and bias-extension methods were obtained compared to the standard picture-frame method.},

Selected mechanical properties of knitted composites, and some of the predictive models available for determining them are also reviewed. To conclude, a number of current and potential applications of knitting for engineering composites are highlighted. With a comprehensive review of the subject, it is believed that textile engineers would be able to better understand the requirements of advanced composites for knitting, and, by the same token, composites engineers can have a better appreciation of the capability and limitations of knitting for composite reinforcement.

	Abstract = {Wrinkling often occurs during textile composite forming and is a major problem for manufacturers. The prediction of this defect is, therefore, of major importance for the design and optimization of textile composite structures. Numerical simulations of forming for textile composites over a hemisphere have been conducted using a rate/temperature-dependent hybrid FE model. The hybrid FE model incorporates a fully predictive multi-scale energy model which determines the shear resistance of the textile composite sheet. The effects of varying the normal force distribution across the edges of the blank and blank size, together with the effect of changes in forming temperature on the final fibre pattern and wrinkling behaviour, are investigated. Predictions are evaluated against press-formed components. The results from the simulation and the experiments have good correlation and show that wrinkling can be minimized by optimizing the force distribution around the edge of the manufacturing tool and by careful choice of forming temperature. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show that the stabilization vector gamma can be obtained naturally by taking the partial derivatives with respect to the natural coordinates. Hence, the components of the strains and stresses can be expressed in terms of a set of orthogonal coordinates. With these definitions of stresses and strains, a general form of the finite element stabilization matrices is then constructed for underintegrated, irregular shape and anisotropic elements. The explicit expressions of the stabilization matrices for the 4-, 9- and 8-node Laplace and continuum elements and the 4-node plate element are then derived from the general form. These are sufficiently general for the developments herein. The generalization of the stabilization-matrices concept to nonlinear problems which usually require the numerical integration of a fairly general class of nonlinear, finite-deformation constitutive equations is also presented.

The computer implementation aspects and numerical evaluation of these stabilized elements are also considered. Numerical tests confirm the stability and accuracy characteristics of the resulting elements. In particular, the numerical experiments reported here also show that the rates of convergence in the L2-norm and in the energy norm agree well with the expected convergence rates.},

  abstract      = {The geometry of multiaxial multiply carbon reinforcement under shear deformation is studied. A description based on the distortions of the fibres bundles, induced by the stitch yarn is proposed. These distortions are recognised to be dominant for the impregnation behaviour and the damage initiation, since they form flow channels for the impregnating resin and resin rich zones after impregnation, respectively. The centers of the distortions, referred to as Stitch Yarn induced fibre Distortions (SYD), are located on an equidistant grid, which cell length and width is determined by the needle spacing and the stitch distance in machine direction. The dimensions of the distortions are analysed and presented as averaged values plus a distribution. The distribution of the measured dimensions of the \{SYDs\} are found to be lognormal rather than normal. A stepwise function is proposed to describe the relation between fabric shear deformation and the width of the SYDs. No significant changes in the length were observed. The distribution and change of the dimensions can be employed as geometrical input for permeability or micro-mechanical models.},

Simulations have been carried out within the scope of large transformations, accounting for yarn‚{\"A}{\`\i}yarn contacts, and assuming that yarns behave as hypoelastic materials with transverse isotropy. From the simulated deformed solid RVE, a complementary periodic fluid \{RVE\} is then built and the slow flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid within it is investigated.

This paper discusses these three applications of the full-field strain measurements and providing examples of studies of deformability of woven (glass and glass/PP) and non-crimp (carbon) textile reinforcements. The authors conclude that optical full-field strain techniques are the preferable (sometimes the only) way of assuring correct deformation measurements during tensile or shear tests of textile.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the internal geometry of 2D and 3D woven fabrics is used as a unit-cell geometry preprocessor for meso-mechanical models of composite materials. The model computes a spatial placement of all yarns in a fabric repeat for a given weave structure (a special coding algorithm is employed) and given warp and weft yarns geometrical and mechanical parameters. The source of these data is the manufacturer's documentation for a woven fabric and yarn mechanical behaviour in bending and compression and measured on standard textile-laboratory equipment. The principle of minimum energy of a fibrous assembly leads to the prediction of the yarns crimp and the forces in the warp/weft contacts and the yarn compression within a fabric. The input data for use in meso-mechanical models of composite materials is therefore provided in addition to tools for the 3D representation of the woven structure and for the creation of the unit-cell cross-sections and for the computation of the unit cell porosity},

  abstract      = {Meso-scale (unit cell of an impregnated textile reinforcement) finite element (FE) modelling of textile composites is a powerful tool for homogenisation of mechanical properties, study of stress‚{\"A}{\`\i}strain fields inside the unit cell, determination of damage initiation conditions and sites and simulation of damage development and associated deterioration of the homogenised mechanical properties of the composite. Meso-FE can be considered as a part of the micro-meso‚{\"A}{\`\i}macro multi-level modelling process, with micro-models (fibres in the matrix) providing material properties for homogenised impregnated yarns and fibrous plies, and macro-model (structural analysis) using results of meso-homogenisation. The paper discusses stages of the meso-FE analysis and proposes a succession of steps (‚{\"A}{\'u}road map‚{\"A}?) and the corresponding algorithms for it: (1) Building a model of internal geometry of the reinforcement; (2) Transferring the geometry into a volume description (‚{\"A}{\'u}solid‚{\"A}? CAD-model); (3) Preparation for meshing: correction of the interpenetration of volumes of yarns in the solid model and providing space for the thin matrix layers between the yarns; (4) Meshing; (5) Assigning local material properties of the impregnated yarns and the matrix; (6) Definition of the minimum possible unit cell using symmetry of the reinforcement and assigning periodic boundary conditions; (7) Homogenisation procedure; (8) Damage initiation criteria; (9) Damage propagation modelling. The ‚{\"A}{\'u}road map‚{\"A}? is illustrated by examples of meso-FE analysis of woven and braided composites.},

	Abstract = {Forming simulations of textile preforms require a description of the shear resistance of the preform plies. Experimental determination of the shear diagrams is time consuming and costly and requires highly qualified personnel. Typical glass rovings exhibit quite consistent behaviour and described by diagrams for bending and compression and tension and in function of linear density of the rovings. Based on these representative diagrams and a parametrical study of the shear resistance of glass preforms has been carried out and using a model and which accounts for different sources of the fabric resistance to shear: friction and compression of the yarns and yarn (un)bending and Possible simultaneous action of shear and (pre)tension is taken into account. The model (validated against experimental data) generates shear diagrams for plain and twill and 5-harness satin square fabrics. The diagrams were then processed to create analytical expressions of the shear diagrams: T = T0 + T1 tanac and where T is the shear force and c is the shear angle and a and T0 and and T1 are parameters and tabulated as functions of yarn linear density and fabric tightness and pretension. The value of a was found to be close to 2 in all the cases. The resulting family of shear diagrams was verified against experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Textile materials are characterised by the distinct hierarchy of structure and which should be represented by a model of textile geometry and mechanical behaviour. In spite of a profound investigation of textile materials and a number of theoretical models existing in the textile literature for different structures and a model covering all structures typical for composite reinforcements is not available. Hence the challenge addressed in the present work is to take full advantage of the hierarchical principle of textile modelling and creating a truly integrated modelling and design tool for textile composites It allows handling of complex textile structure computations in computer time counted by minutes instead of hours of the same non-linear and non-conservative behaviour of yarns in compression and bending. The architecture of the code implementing the model corresponds to the hierarchical structure of textile materials. The model of the textile geometry serves as a base for meso-mechanical and permeability models for composites and which provide therefore simulation tools for analysis of composites processing and properties. The paper presents an approach to model the behaviour of a representative volume element (RVE) of textile reinforcement in in-plane deformation (bi-axial tension and shear) and in compression. With the internal geometry of the RVE built and the model computes overall parameters of the deformed textile and such as fibre volume fraction and porosity etc. The internal geometry is visualised and such properties as pore structure in typical cross-sections are analysed. The internal geometry description is further fed into flow modelling software and which allow computing local permeability and mechanical properties of the deformed reinforcement.},

Unfortunately, their medium to high processing and temperature-dependent properties, and the complex deformations mechanisms that occur within the composite sheet during the forming have all presented problems in the practical production of parts. This has contributed to a reluctance by industry to accept these materials. This paper shows how numerical simulation may be usefully applied in order to obtain a better understanding of the press forming of CFRTP. Detailed investigation using both experimental and numerical techniques of the press forming of an CFRTP component are presented. The part under investigation is a \&lsquo;sikken\&rsquo; (half-cylinder with quarter spheres at both ends). Forming parameters such as the choice of the holding system, the use of a blank holder, the punch velocity, the stacking sequence are all investigated.

A detailed study of two angle interlock 3D woven carbon fabrics has been carried out to characterise these architectural features and how they change under increasing levels of compaction. Computerised tomography (CT) X-ray scanning was used to capture the internal architecture of the fabrics. The study focussed on the out-of-plane crimp of the yarns and the size and shape of resin rich regions in consolidated panels. Results showed areas of high local crimp at weft/weaver interlace points. This was exacerbated at low levels of compaction but was eventually lowered under higher compaction levels. The appearance of resin channels was found to be heavily dependent on weave style, with large resin pockets appearing in weaver yarn planes which decreased significantly in size under compaction with distinctive changes in profile.},

	Abstract = {Textile composites have been used for various applications because of their enhanced strength/weight ratio and versatile properties compared to other materials such asmetals. Many studies have investigated the tribological behaviour of textilecomposites and but none have focused onthe tribological characterization of 3D multilayeredwoven reinforced textile composites. Five types of 3-plywoven interlocked structures with varying interlacements were used as reinforcement for the nylon fibre/polyester resin composites for the present study. The influence of the textile structure interlacement on the tribological properties of the composite material (in terms ofwear volume)was investigated in thiswork. Further and special attention was given to understand the effect of sliding frequency on the tribological behaviour and driving wear mechanisms. The tests were conducted on a new class of reciprocating sliding wear tester and in dry (unlubricated) conditions and under a fixed applied load of 20N by varying the frequency of oscillating motion (0.5<f<8 Hz). In addition and testswere also conducted and at a constant frequency of 4Hz and as a function of several loads (5N to 40 N). Fromthese tests and a 3-plywoven reinforced composite with the best tribological performance as a function of frequency and load was identified. It was observed that the type of woven structure had an influence on the tribological properties. Therefore and the selection of a textile composite should be based on the load and frequency at the service condition. The wear mechanisms involved in the tribological process were also analysed.},

Following the analytical approaches on transverse permeability of fiber bundles, a comprehensive experimental set-up has been derived to verify the effects of temperature boundary conditions, resident time, consolidation pressure and fiber bundle permeability on the degree of impregnation. Samples with reinforcements of glass and carbon fabrics were produced at distinct processing conditions and the degree of impregnation was investigated by microscopic observation and mirrored by measuring the flexural stiffness in a three-point bending test. Hence, contribution of particular processing properties on impregnation was discussed in detail and the results are to be applied to guide the manufacturing process concerning selection of appropriate raw materials and optimized processing conditions. It could be concluded, that the continuous manufacturing process using a double belt press might basically be simulated by applying the current analytical approaches on the impregnation of fibers with thermoplastic polymers, but exhibits its own characteristics with respect to intra-bundle mechanism such as microscopic adhesion and void entrapment.},

In addition, the draping behavior of the \{NCFs\} was experimentally evaluated to assess the suitability of the developed \{NCF\} materials for being exploited in composite component manufacturing technologies involving direct lay-up processes. A complete series of tests, including hot forming tests, quality evaluation of the produced parts and drapeability tests, was also carried out for the thermoplastic composite APC-2/AS4 (PEEK reinforced with carbon fibers) to obtain a reference for comparison. The comparison has shown that the hot forming process may be used to shape simple parts from thermoplastic \{NCF\} composites providing an acceptable quality at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, the improved drapeability of the \{NCF\} material allows for a direct lay-up in a curved form tool. Finally, an assessment of the potential of the developed \{NCF\} composites for use in aircraft structural applications was made.},

	Abstract = {Textile fabric geometry determines textile composite properties. Textile process mechanics determines fabric geometry. In previous papers and the authors proposed a digital element model to generate textile composite geometry by simulating the textile process. The greatest difficulty encountered with its employment in engineering practice is efficiency. A full scale fiber-based digital element analysis would consume huge computational resources. Two advances are developed in this paper to overcome the problem of efficiency. An improved contact-element formulation is developed first. The new formulation improves accuracy. As such and it permits a coarse digital element mesh. Then and a static relaxation algorithm to determine fabric micro-geometry is established to replace step-by-step textile process simulation. Employing the modified contact element formulation in the static relaxation approach and the required computer resource is only 1{\~n}2% of the resource required by the original process. Two critical issues with regards to the digital element mesh are also examined: yarn discretization and initial yarn cross-section shape. Fabric geometries derived from digital element analysis are compared to experimental results.},

Therefore, it is of interest to incorporate a quantitative description of actual three-dimensional microstructures in the mechanical analysis of materials. In this contribution, an experimental-computational methodology has been developed to facilitate finite element method simulations of complex three-dimensional cellular structures, i.e. to open-cell Ni and Al foams. Two different approaches were examined to visualize the exact three-dimensional (3D) structure of the examined Ni and Al foams, X-ray computed tomography and a serial sectioning image-based process, respectively. In situ micro-tensile tests were carried out in order to determine the foam mechanical properties while scanning electron microscopy was used to monitor the deformation and fracture of the struts. Both experimental results and FEM simulations reveal that the distributions of local stresses and strains depend on size, orientation, and spatial arrangement of the pores.},

  abstract      = {Abstract To study the potential of flax tows in composite processing as an alternative to flax spun yarns, a flat flax tow consisting of aligned fibre bundles held together by a natural binder was used and characterised in tension under various conditions. The effect of the gauge length was studied on the dry reinforcement. The experimental results showed that the mechanical properties and failure mechanism varied significantly depending on the gauge length and are discussed in relation to the distribution of elementary fibres within the tow. A characteristic length as from which the mechanical properties are stable has been identified. At this length, the effect of the strain rate on the tensile properties was measured and their sensitivity to the strain rate suggests a viscous effect in the behaviour of the flax tow. To approach process conditions such as wet filament winding, a batch of specimens was impregnated with epoxy prior to tensile testing. The tensile properties under wet conditions were found to be close to the properties under dry conditions and shows that the tow can withstand typical processing tensions. Finally, tensile tests on cured-impregnated tows showed interesting mechanical properties for composite application.},

  abstract      = {Fluid flow analyses for porous media are of great importance in a wide range of industrial applications
including, but not limited to, resin transfer moulding, filter analysis, transport of underground water
and pollutants, and hydrocarbon recovery. Permeability is perhaps the most important property that
characterizes porous media; however, its determination for different types of porous media is challenging
due its complex dependence on the pore-level structure of the media. In the present work, fluid flow in
three-dimensional random fibrous media is simulated using the lattice Boltzmann method. We determine
the permeability of the medium using the Darcy law across a wide range of void fractions
(0.08 6 / 6 0.99) and find that the values for the permeability that we obtain are consistent with available
experimental data. We use our numerical data to develop a semi-empirical constitutive model for
the permeability of fibrous media as a function of their porosity and of the fibre diameter. The model,
which is underpinned by the theoretical analysis of flow through cylinder arrays presented by [Gebart
BR. Permeability of unidirectional reinforcements for RTM. J Compos Mater 1992; 26(8): 1100{\~n}33], gives
an excellent fit to these data across the range of /. We perform further simulations to determine the
impact of the curvature and aspect ratio of the fibres on the permeability. We find that curvature has
a negligible effect, and that aspect ratio is only important for fibres with aspect ratio smaller than 6:1,
in which case the permeability increases with increasing aspect ratio. Finally, we calculate the permeability
tensor for the fibrous media studied and confirm numerically that, for an isotropic medium, the permeability
tensor reduces to a scalar value.},

In particular it gives the direction and density of the fibres that condition the permeability of the textile reinforcement and the mechanical properties of the final composite. These meso \{FE\} analyses are highly dependent on the quality of the initial geometry of the model. Some software have been developed to describe composite reinforcement geometries. The obtained geometries imply simplification that can disrupts the reinforcement deformation computation. The present paper presents a direct method using computed tomography to determine finite element models based on the real geometry of the textile reinforcement. The F.E. model is obtained for any specificity or variability of the textile reinforcement. The interpenetration problems are avoided. The determination of the fibre direction at each point of the model is detailed. It is a key point for the quality of the deformation simulation. A comparison between \{FE\} models obtained from {\OE}ºCT and from a textile geometrical modeller shows that the description of the variability taken into account by the first one leads to a better result.},

This paper presents a multiscale modeling technique to simulate the impact of flexible woven fabrics. This technique involves modeling the fabric using a yarn level architecture around the impact region and a homogenized or membrane type architecture at far field regions. The level of modeling resolution decreases with distance away from the impact zone. This results in a finite element model with much lower computational requirements. The yarns are modeled using both solid and shell finite elements. Impedances are matched across all interfaces created between the various regions of the model to prevent artificial reflections of the longitudinal strain waves. A systematic approach is presented to determine geometric and material parameters of the homogenized zone. The multiscale model is extensively validated against baseline models. The limitations of using shell elements to model the yarn level architecture underneath the projectile are addressed.},

This approach and referred to as the hybrid element analysis (HEA) is based on decreasing the complexity of the finite element model with distance away from the impact zone based on the multiscale nature of the fabric architecture and the physics of the impact event. Solid elements are used to discretize the yarns around the impact region and which transition to shell elements in the surrounding region. A new method for modeling the shell yarns is incorporated that more accurately represents the contours of the yarn cross section. Impedances have been matched across the solideshell interface to prevent interfacial reflections of the longitudinal strain wave. The HEA method is validated by first applying it to the FE model of a single yarn for which an analytical solution is known. The HEA method is then applied to a woven fabric model and validated by comparing it against a baseline model consisting of yarns discretized using only solid elements.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses the optimum design method of the weaving structure of three-dimensional (3-D) reinforced composites. We propose the design method which combines the genetic algorithms (GA) and the finite element analysis. GA is one of the optimization techniques for the combinatorial optimization problem. In the finite element analysis and we used the original structure model which can express the fiber arrangement state in the 3-D composites faithfully. In this study and the original weaving structure model is constructed by combining the basic structure which has the fiber bundle and the cubic grid of resin. From analysis results and in the small design region and we can obtain the optimum weaving structure. Moreover and we proposed a new genetic operation and to design the weaving structure at the larger design region. These operations aim to prevent the failure of the partial weaving structure in the analytical model as much as possible. From the analysis results and the optimum weaving structure is obtained at the large design region and similar to above results. Consequently and it seems that the proposed method enables the design of the optimum weaving structure in the 3-D composites.},

A flax fibre plain-weave fabric has been used to form a complex tetrahedron shape. This shape is of particular interest as it contains several geometric singularities required by many automotive parts such as double or triple curvature and low-curvature edges. Globally, the complex tetrahedron shape was obtained, but tow buckling (out of plane bending of tows) was observed in specific zones of the shape. The main mechanism at the origin of this defect has been defined. A reduction of the tow buckle size was obtained by increasing the membrane tension. The influence of fabric architecture at the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales on the appearance of the tow buckles was demonstrated and discussed. Solutions to prevent the appearance of this defect based on the design of the fabric architecture at the tow or fabric scales were successfully proposed. As a consequence, when sheet forming of complex shapes is considered, specific fabric architectures should be chosen to prevent the appearance of the buckling defect.},

A typical plain-weave fabric in a bias extension state is considered. A series of tests were conducted to characterise basic yarn/fabric properties. The analysis in this study consists of two parts. Firstly and a uniform shear state of the fabric is considered and the relationship of shear force vs shear angle is established. The predicted values agree well with the measured results. Secondly and a non-uniform shear state is explored and the manner in which a change of the shear angle could affect the yarn slippage is indicated. It is shown that for a fabric having yarns with high bending rigidity such slippage could be significant. In the analysis both beam-deflection theory and finite element methods are used.},

The present models are validated by a comparison between simulation results and experimental data. The simulation results successfully represent important features of the void physics: the correlation of void formation at the flow front with capillary number, the advantage of vacuum application at air vents to reduce the void content inside tows, and the existence of partially saturated zone behind the global flow front. The representation of mold filling patterns by a degree of saturation shows the presence of a bubbly zone behind the flow front.},

The purpose of composites is to allow the new materials to have strengths from both materials, often times covering the original materials weaknesses. Composites are usually classified by the type of reinforcements they use. These reinforcements are embedded into a matrix that holds it together. The reinforcements are used to strengthen the composites. This chapter discusses four types of composites‚{\"A}{\^\i}namely, polymer matrix composites, carbon matrix composites, metal matrix composites, and ceramic matrix composites. Polymer matrix composites are plastics (resins) within which there are embedded fibers. The plastic is known as the matrix, and the fibers orientated within it are known as the reinforcement. The reinforcement tends to be stiffer and stronger than the matrix providing stiffness and strength. The primary reason why polymer matrix composites are chosen for the manufacture of components is because of the weight saving relative to their stiffness and strength.},

There is now increasing interest in using the process to manufacture high fibre volume fraction composites for structural applications. Experiments have been conducted to monitor the force required to compress a typical plain-woven glass fibre reinforcement.

	Abstract = {In judging the feel or "handle" of a material and use is made of such sensations as stiffness or limpness and hardness or softness and and roughness or smoothness. It is desirable to devise physical tests that analyse and reflect the sensations felt and assign numerical values to the measurements. The present paper describes tests that reflect the first groups of sensations and namely and stiffness and hardness and whilst the sensation that is experienced in stroking a material and obviously connected with frictional properties and will be dealt with in another paper.

An instrument is described on which it is possible to measure the angle through which a specimen of cloth droops when a definite length is held out over an edge. By means of a mathematical formula that is fully developed in an appendix to the paper this angle is converted into a term called the bending length of the material. This quantity may be defined as the length of fabric that will bend under its own weight to a definite extent. It is strictly a measure of the draping quality of a fabric. The stiffer the material and the longer is the "bending length."

From the "bending length" and the weight of the material and a simple calculation gives a quantity called the flexural rigidity which measures the resistance to bending or the stiffness that would be appreciated by the fingers. These two quantities should be measured both along the weft and along the warp in woven fabrics and but it is unnecessary to apply the test in any diagonal direction. The stiffness of the fabric as a whole is completely governed by the warp-way and weft-way stiffnesses and and these separate quantities may be converted into a single quantity for stiffness in any direction.

Another property that is sensed when a fabric is grasped is thickness and but this depends on the amount by which the material is squeezed and so that the sensation combines that of thickness and hardness. The measurement of thickness is discussed in detail and for it is not so simple as it might appear. Having standardised the method and however and it is easy to measure hardness by determining thickness under different pressures.

It is often desirable to compare the stiffness of materials of different thicknesses and for example and to compare a cloth before and after a process like calendering. For this purpose the above flexural rigidity may be converted into a quantity called the bending modulus that takes account of thickness. Flexural rigidity itself is highly dependent on thickness; in fact and doubling the thickness increases the flexural rigidity eightfold. The bending modulus on the other hand and is in a sense a measure of the intrinsic stiffness of the material. Generally speaking and it reflects the degree of compactness and or of the adhesion between fibres and threads{\'o}the difference between what is described as a "full" handle and "papery."

The standard procedure for determining bending length may be varied with regard to the shape and dimensions of the test specimen for very stiff or very limp materials and and the alternative calculations are demonstrated. A different but more laborious method for measuring flexural rigidity is also described in connection with a study of the effect of humidity on the stiffness of organdie.},

	Abstract = {A novel procedure for predicting the effective nonlinear elastic moduli of textile composites through a combined approach of the homogenization method and the finite element formulation is presented. The homogenization method is first applied to investigate the meso-microscopic material behavior of a single fiber yarn based on the properties of the constituent phases. The obtained results are compared to existing analytical and experimental results to validate the homogenization method. Very good agreements have been obtained. A unit cell is then built to enclose the characteristic periodic pattern in the textile composites. Various numerical tests such as uni-axial and bi-axial extension and trellising tests are performed by 3D finite element analysis on the unit cell. Characteristic behaviors of force versus displacement are obtained. Meanwhile, trial mechanical elastic constants are imposed on a four-node shell element with the same outer size as the unit cell to match the force-displacement curves. The effective nonlinear mechanical stiffness tensor is thus obtained numerically as functions of elemental strains. The procedure is exemplified on a plain weave glass composite and is validated by comparing to experimental data. Using the proposed approach, the nonlinear behavior of textile composites can be anticipated accurately and efficiently. ¬{\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By taking advantage of the tensile{\~n}shear decoupling in the constitutive equation under the convected coordinate system and the material characterization of woven fabrics is simplified. As an essential part for these transformations and a fiber orientation model is developed and by using some fundamental continuum mechanics concepts and to trace the yarn reorientation of woven fabrics during deformation. The proposed material characterization approach is demonstrated on a balanced plain weave composite fabric. The equivalent material properties are obtained by matching with experimental data of tensile and bias extension tests on the woven composite fabric. Model validation is provided by comparing numerical results with experimental data of bias extension test and shear test. The development of this non-orthogonal model is critical to the ultimate goal and i.e. using numerical simulations to optimize the forming of woven composite fabric sheets.},

  abstract      = {Abstract: Each layer of non-crimp fabric (NCF) in a blanket has fibres that are essentially straight with a distinct orientation and uniform thickness. Consequently, for analysis purposes, each layer may be treated as an individual ply in classical laminate theory (Jones and Pickett, 2005). Similarly, it is reasonable to apply the same assumptions to a finite element (FE) analysis and most work to date has treated each layer as a quasi-unidirectional ply. However, some provisos need to be considered. First, bi-axial \{NCFs\} are commonly used for complex doubly curved geometries and can be required to undergo considerable drape deformation. This draping will deform fabric architecture changing properties such as infusion permeability and mechanical stiffness. Characterisation of mechanical properties for deformed \{NCF\} is a topic of current research; see for example Crooktson, Long and Jones (2002) for elastic properties, Greve and Pickett (2006) for failure, and Chapter 11 for mesoscopic analysis of deformed NCF. \{FE\} analysis of \{NCF\} covers a wide range of applications including draping, resin infusion, residual stress, static stress and impact analysis, amongst others. A brief review of relevant \{FE\} methods is first given, followed by their application to drape, infusion and stress/impact analysis, with some examples.},

So far most applications have concerned metal parts and processes with only a limited number of works investigating composite materials. This situation and particularly for industries now dependant on a simulation based design and will have to change if composites are to be seriously considered as a substitute for metals. This paper presents an overview of simulation applied to specific composites problems including sheet forming and 3D-braiding and impact. This work represents nearly a decade of research and development in various national and European projects. It is shown that significant progress has been made and that these complex problems can now be tackled by using state-of-the-art commercial software.},

	Abstract = {Rotary braiding is a cost effective method to manufacture near net shaped preforms that generally have a closed section and may have an arbitrary shape if braiding is performed over a shaped mandrel. The reinforcement architecture can be varied by the number and spacing of active bobbins and and by the speeds used to {\"e}take-up{\'\i} the braid and move the circumferential bobbins. Analytical methods are available that can reliably predict yarn paths and the final braid meso-structure for simple regular sections and and further analytical methods have been proposed to estimate composite braid elastic mechanical properties. A full simulation chain using the explicit Finite Element (FE) technique is presented for composite braid manufacture and mechanical stiffness prediction of the final composite. First simulation of the braiding process provides detailed information on yarns paths and braid meso-structure and from which Representative Volume Elements (RVE) of the braid may be constructed for analysis of stiffness properties. The techniques are general and can be applied to any braid geometry. A specific problem of meshing the yarn structure and interspersed resin volumes is overcome using conventional solid elements for the yarns and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics for the resin and with link element to join the two constituents. Details of the background theory and braid simulation methods and meso- model analysis and validation again analytical and test measurements are presented.},

Shear angles and computed directly from global strains and were in close agreement to those measured using an optical method. Constitutive shear stress{\~n}strain relation and computed from the bias extension test data and was in good agreement with KES (Kawabata Evaluation System) test results. Meso-scale tow deformations have been measured using two techniques: an inexpensive flatbed scanner-based full-field strain measurement technique for measuring in-plane tow deformations and a strain-freezing technique for measuring through-thickness tow deformations. With this data and a 3D Representative Volume Element (RVE) can be constructed for each stage of shear deformation. Beyond the geometric shear limit and tow deformations during bias extension appear to be somewhat different from those normally expected from pure shear{\'o}a reduction in tow thickness and tow cross-sectional area and a corresponding increase in packing factor.},

	Abstract = {As new developments are brought to the group of manufacturing processes for composite parts known as liquid composites molding (LCM) and the compaction behavior of the textile reinforcements is increasingly seen as an important parameter of the definition of these processes. The evolution of the permeability tensor of the reinforcements with time and the general kinetics of the manufacturing operations and and the modelization of these processes depend on a large extent on the compaction behavior of the reinforcements used and especially in flexible-wall FUM and autoclave molding. Also and more research efforts are devoted toward the development of a complete analytical model of the properties of heterogeneous textile reinforcements. In this paper the published experimental data related to the compaction and relaxation of random mats and woven reinforcements are gathered. Observed pararneters are defined and which allow numerical comparisons of the experimental curves to be made and as well as the identification of general trends seen with most tested reinforcements. The effects of various processing parameters are identified and and relations to published analytical models of the mechanical properties of fibrous assemblies are discussed.},

The purpose of these geometric descriptions is to act as domains for calculations preformed at the scale of the unit cell and where the heterogeneity of the material must be considered. The algorithm defines both the volumes of the tows and the empty volumes that extend between the tows within the calculation domain and for general textiles. Resulting geometric descriptions are provided as assemblies of topologically simple volumes that encompass either part of a tow or part of an empty volume. Typical applications of the geometric definitions include the calculation of local permeability values for textile preforms and the investigation of local stress distributions in textile composites.},

One of these factors involves the use of the availability of different fabricating processes. All processes fit into an overall scheme that requires interaction and proper control of different operations. Factors such as good engineering product design and selecting the appropriate plastic are very important but only represent pieces of the ‚{\"A}{\'u}pie.‚{\"A}? Philosophical many different ingredients blend together to produce profitable products. Fabricating is one of the important main ingredients. In addition to fabricating in-house, there is fabricating outsourcing that also requires controls. It is also called contract manufacturing or professional services. Different fabricating processes and materials of construction are employed to produce \{RP\} products (fibers and reinforcing additives) that represent about 20 wt% of all plastic products produced worldwide. Injection molding consumes over 75 wt% of all \{RP\} materials with practically all of it being RTPs.},

The latter were applied to two simple shapes in attempts to provide more uniform coverage than conventional fabric-forming processes.

All possible mechanisms of deformation including elongation and bending and compression of yarns have been considered. A modified geometry of yarn path based on a polynomial has been proposed. The predictions are compared with experimental data reported in literature as well as the finite element analysis.

	Abstract = {The compression of a typical fibre plain woven cloth was studied experimentally by performing a series of mechanical tests on dry and resin impregnated cloths and from microstructural studies of specimens cured under compression. The experiments included investigations of the effects of applied pressure and speed of compression and cloth orientation on the fibre volume fraction and Vf and of the compressed assembly. It was found that the compression of dry cloths followed a power law relationship between pressure and Vf where the power law index was determined to be approximately equal to 10 for assemblies of 5 and 10 and 20 dry cloths. The microstructural studies provided data for the distance between plies and the amplitude and the wavelength of the yarn waveform and the area and geometrical parameters of the yam cross-section at different compression pressures. It was concluded that the compression of resin impregnated woven cloths could be considered as a combination of three modes of deformation: (1) nesting of cloths; (2) deformation of the yam waveform; and (3) deformation of the yarn crosssection.},

The exceptional formability properties (i.e. the ability of a textile preform structure to conform to a 3-D shape) that weft-knit preforms have enable the fabrication of 3-D composite structures by means of resin transfer moulding (RTM). This paper is part one of a two-part series, in which the deformation of weft-knit preforms by the use of a modified California bearing-ratio (CBR) test method is examined. This paper reports the relationship between the physical, mechanical and simulated formability properties of weft-knit glass-fibre preforms. The results for the full milano structure showed that the plain loop length and tensile properties enabled a good prediction of simulated formability. It also investigates the effects of different knit structures on the deformation of weft-knit preforms. The other structures examined include the alternating half milano, full milano, French double piqu√{\copyright} and full cardigan. The results in this section indicate that irrespective of structure, the loop length and tensile properties determine the simulated formability of weft-knit preforms.

The main goal is the representation of the governing constitutive equations within the framework of the invariant theory which automatically fulfill the polyconvexity condition in the sense of Ball in order to guarantee the existence of minimizers. Based on the introduction of additional argument tensors, the so-called structural tensors, the free energies and the anisotropic stress response functions are represented by scalar-valued and tensor-valued isotropic tensor functions, respectively. In order to obtain various free energies to model specific problems which permit the matching of data stemming from experiments, we assume an additive structure. A variety of isotropic and anisotropic functions for transversely isotropic material behaviour are derived, where each individual term fulfills a priori the polyconvexity condition. The tensor generators for the stresses and moduli are evaluated in detail and some representative numerical examples are presented. Furthermore, we propose an extension to orthotropic symmetry.},

  abstract      = {There is a noticeable lack of fatigue data on plant fibre composites (PFCs) which seriously limits their prospective use in fatigue critical components. The objective of this manuscript is to provide a complete set of fatigue data on vacuum infused aligned PFCs. S‚{\"A}{\`\i}N lifetime diagrams have been constructed to investigate the effect of (i) plant fibre type/quality, (ii) fibre content, (iii) textile architecture, and (iv) stress ratio, on \{PFC\} cyclic loading behaviour. At each stage, the fatigue performance of \{PFCs\} is compared to that of E-glass/polyester (GFRP) composites. A comprehensive constant-life diagram has been generated to facilitate life prediction of \{PFC\} components. While plant fibre type and quality, textile architecture and composite fibre content have a significant impact on the static properties, they have little impact on the material fatigue strength coefficient b (which dictates the slope of the S‚{\"A}{\`\i}N curve). In essence, higher static properties are a sign of superior fatigue loading capacities throughout their lifetime. Increasing stress ratios lead to improved fatigue performance in PFCs. Fracture mechanisms and modes are the same for composites made from three different bast fibres, but depend on fibre content, textile architecture and stress ratios. Although the absolute fatigue performance of \{GFRPs\} is far superior to PFCs, it is a revelation to find that fatigue strength degradation rates are lower in \{PFCs\} than in GFRP.},

	Abstract = {A composite with unidirectional carbon fibers (CF) (=80 vol.%) and high performance thermoplastic polyetherimide matrix (PEI) was developed and evaluated for various mechanical properties as a function of fiber orientation angle (0∞ and 15∞ and 30∞ and 45∞ and 60∞ and 75∞ and 90∞) with respect to loading direction. It was observed that in general and these properties deteriorated with the increase in fiber orientation angle and though composite with 90∞ fibers was not poorest in mechanical properties. Overall and CF reinforcement in 0∞ (parallel to loading direction) enhanced all strength and modulus properties of PEI significantly. Tribo-evaluation in adhesive wear mode on pin on disc machine against mild steel under different loads indicated that the coefficient of friction increased with fiber angle with respect to sliding direction and decreased with load and in general. Very low specific wear rate (K0) and in the order of 4{\~n}7◊10-16m3/Nm was observed for 0∞ orientation while fibers in 90∞ showedwear rate in the range of 14-25◊10-16m3/Nm and which was approximately four times higher than the earlier case. Overall fiber reinforcement in 0∞ orientation proved beneficial from both strength and tribo-performance point of view. SEM proved useful to correlate wear rate with wear mechanisms. Gradual decrease in extent of wear thinning of long fibers and increase in brittle fracture of fibers and their peeling off tendency from the matrix with increase in angle of fiber orientation were observed to be the main reasons for the deterioration of tribo-properties of composites with increase in fiber orientation in composites from 0∞ to 90∞.},

	Abstract = {A model for draping of woven fabric is described which is intermediate to the two main approaches currently used, kinematic modelling and comprehensive finite element modelling. The approach used is a simple unit-cell finite element model, with the fabric modelled by a network of simple truss elements, connected across the 'diagonals' by soft elements to mimic the shear stiffness of the material. Bias extension tests on dry fabric are used both to calibrate and validate the model. The model is then used to simulate draping of an ellipsoid. The capability of the model is illustrated by construction of a simple process optimisation map for this geometry. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Textile fibers are characterized by many parameters and used by both researchers and industrial users. Many studies focus on the effect of fiber length and fineness and maturity (only for cotton) and tensile properties and etc. on the properties of intermediate products and yarns. Contrary and few studies concerning the fiber surface properties and especially the inter-fiber friction and appear in the scientific literature. A newand simple device is designed and used in this. It enables the measurement of inter-fiber friction force during the dissociation of an ordinary sliver. Contrary to what has previously been mentioned in the scientific literature and the study of a set of different cottons shows that the inter-fiber friction seems to obey the Amontons{\'\i} law rather than a more complex power law model. The calculated inter-fiber friction coefficient helps to differentiate the different types of cotton and to bring to the fore the non-negligible effect of the friction on yarn irregularity and imperfections and affecting the yarn tenacity indirectly. Meanwhile and this work has revealed a curious grouping of different types of cotton and which is not observed before. This phenomenon is undoubtedly due to the surface properties of fibers.},

Today the use of non-crimp fabrics (NCF) is limited to automobiles in the luxury segment. Following this some recent examples of \{NCF\} components are discussed. These components only find application in high-end cars. The reasons for \{NCF\} components not being used for the mass production of automobiles are explained.

The model development builds upon previous work on simulation of fabric draping using a truss representation of the woven material. Tows are modelled by stiff elastic bar elements, and the non-linear rate dependent shear behaviour is incorporated in elastic-viscoplastic elements that follow an appropriate phenomenological constitutive model. Wrinkling due to tow buckling is simulated by allowing the deactivation of tow elements that undergo compressive deformation. The model convergence is tested and its validity is checked against experimental results from the forming of pre-impregnated woven carbon hemispheres. It is found that the model reproduces successfully experimental measurements of shear and wrinkling with a relative error of approximately 4%, while solution times are kept below 60&#xa0;s on a conventional PC. These features allow potential iterative use of the model within a process optimisation scheme. The sensitivity of the process outcome to process parameters such as blank holder force and forming speed is investigated.},

  abstract      = {A stochastic forming simulation procedure is developed and implemented to investigate the effect of geometric variability in pre-impregnated woven textiles on manufacturing. Image analysis is used to characterise variability in tow directions and unit cell size in a pre-impregnated carbon/epoxy satin weave textile. It is found that variability in tow orientations is significant, whereas variability in the unit cell size is negligible. Variability in the weft direction is higher than in the warp direction. Highly anisotropic spatial autocorrelation of weft tow orientations is observed with the major direction of autocorrelation normal to the corresponding set of tows. The extent of autocorrelation is 6‚{\"A}{\`\i}20 unit cells. The autocorrelation structure is modelled using a two-parameter stochastic process, the Ornstein‚{\"A}{\`\i}Uhlenbeck sheet, and an efficient parameter estimation technique is developed based on maximum likelihood. The resulting stochastic process is simulated using Cholesky decomposition which is combined with a simplified forming model within a Monte Carlo scheme. The forming model incorporates non-linear strain-rate dependent behaviour and wrinkling due to tow buckling in a truss formulation. Execution of the integrated scheme shows that geometric variability of the woven material has significant influence on the forming process. The coefficient of variation of minimum and average wrinkling strain in the formed component is in the range of 10‚{\"A}{\`\i}20%. Variability affects the results of forming optimisation and it should be taken into account in process design. Although applied to the case of woven textile forming, the stochastic scheme presented in this paper is general and can be applied to any material system with imperfect structure.},

  abstract      = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses certain aspects of the practical utilization of polymers with special attention to processing stage, which plays a decisive role in deciding if a particular polymeric material can be produced as a marketable commodity. It is customary to quote a glass-transition temperature (Tg) for a polymer because it separates two very different regimes of mechanical behavior. Below Tg, the mass of entangled molecules is rigid. Above Tg, viscoelastic effects come into play and it is therefore the lower temperature limit for processing thermoplastics. The structural effect of raising the temperature of a glassy polymer is to provide an input of thermal energy and to increase the vibrations of constituent atoms and molecules. Molecular mobility increases significantly as Tg is approached: rotation about C‚{\"A}{\`\i}C bonds in the chain molecules begins, the free volume of the structure increases, and intermolecular forces weaken. It becomes easier for applied forces to deform the structure and elastic moduli to fall. Finally, the chapter discusses composites, extending from the well-known glass-reinforced polymers to those based upon ceramic and metallic matrices.},

	Abstract = {Constitutive equation are formulated for flow of fabric-reinforced composite materials which show viscous response at the forming temperature. It is shown that in general the characterization for linear viscous response involves five viscosity coefficients, but this number may be reduced as a result of material symmetry of the fabric. In the case in which the material is a plane sheet, the rheological behaviour is described by a single function of the current angle between the fibre directions. The theory is applied to the analysis of the `picture-frame' experiment, and it is shown that this experiment provides a method of measuring the response function. The effect of symmetry of the fabric architecture is considered, and it is found that for some fabric symmetries the theory allows the possibility of different responses to in-plane shearing in different shearing directions, as has been observed in picture-frame experiments. The general theory for nonlinear viscosity is also formulated, and specialized to the analysis of plane sheets, and in particular to the case of a power law fluid. In this case also, it is shown that the material can be characterized by a single response function of the rate-of deformation and the angle between the fibre directions.},

	Abstract = {A new experimental validation method for assessing the accuracy of large-scale finite element (FE) models of bone micro-structure at the apparent and tissue level was developed. Augmented scaled bone replicas were built using rapid prototype machines based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) data. The geometric accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing experimental tests with the replicas to the FE solution based on the same micro-CT data. A new version of the large-scale FE solver was developed to incorporate orthotropic material properties, hence the experimentally determined properties of the rapid prototype material were input into the FE models. The modified FE solver predicted the experimental apparent level stiffness within less than 1%, and the difference between experimental strain gauge measurements and FE-calculated surface stresses was 7% and 49% on a flat and curved surface region, respectively. While absolute error estimates of surface stresses were limited due to strain gauge errors, the relatively larger difference on the curved surface is indicative of the limitations of a hexahedron FE model for representing such geometries. Although the validation approach is applied here for hexahedron based meshes, the method is flexible for varying bone architectures and will be important for validation of future large-scale FE modeling developments that utilize techniques such as mesh smoothing and tetrahedron elements.},

	Abstract = {A vigorous mechanics foundation is established for using a representative volume element (RI/E) to predict the mechanical properties of unidirectional fiber composites. The effective elastic moduli of the composite are determined by finite element analysis of the RVE. It is paramount in such analyses that the correct boundary conditions be imposed such that they simulate the actual deformation within the composite; this has not always been done previously. In the present analysis and the appropriate boundary conditions on the RVE for various loading conditions are determined by judicious use of symmetry and periodicity conditions. The non-homogeneous stress and strain fields within the RVE are related to the average stresses and strains by using Gauss theorem and strain energy equivalence principles. The elastic constants predicted by the finite element analysis agree well with existing theoretical predictions and available experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Fabric drapes are typical large displacement and large rotation and small strain problems. Compared with continuum shell finite element methods and methods that skeletonize the fabric sheet into a set of interconnected nodes appear to be more popular in drape problems with extensive wrinkles. These skeletal methods may resort to particle mechanics and formulate the elastic energy or the equations of motion in terms of the node-to-node distance and the angles between the straight lines joining adjacent nodes. Alternatively and beam elements can be employed to skeletonize the fabric sheet at the expense of using rotational in addition to translational nodal DOFs. In this paper and a new skeletal model based on the small strain and curvature assumptions is devised. In contrast to most and if not all and skeletal models for fabric drape simulation and all the stretching and shearing and bending energies in the model are simple polynomials of the gridpoint displacement. Fabric drape problems with extensive wrinkles are examined. The presence of sharp fold and seam and cut in the undeformed fabric sheet as well as fabric-to-solid contact are considered. The predicted appearances are pleasant and conform to real life observations.},

X-ray radiography is used to observe in-plane matrix cracks and overall delamination propagation; whilst {\OE}ºCT is exploited to examine cross-sectional views showing detailed through-thickness matrix cracks distribution and 3D delamination damage pattern. It is revealed that stitches act as crack initiation sites, due to the presence of weak resin-rich pockets around stitch threads, thus inevitably resulting in densely stitched composites having more stitch-induced matrix cracks upon impact loading. It is also concluded that specimens with higher stitch density and thread thickness are more capable of impeding delamination growth by effectively bridging delamination cracks and arresting crack propagation. {\OE}ºCT evidently shows that 3D delamination pattern in densely stitched composite is more cylindrical in shape, whereas that of a moderately stitched or unstitched composite is more conical.},

	Abstract = {The arrangement and properties and structure of the fibers within the yarn and the yarns within the fabric and generate a complex mechanism of deformation. Therefore the present work intends to develop a theoretical model of the mechanical behavior of the plain weave. The modeling of textile structures by the finite element method is a new approach based on the combination of geometric and mechanical models. The finite element method permits a construction and representation of fabrics by taking into consideration the yarn undulation and the existence or not of symmetries in the basic cell and the type of contact between warp and weft yarns. These different parameters allow the mesh of weaves to be obtained and the closest to the reality and without any restriction and any simplifying assumption. In every model defined by its partial derivative equation of the fabric mechanical behavior and and whatever the method of homogenization employed to obtain a homogeneous model and we will be brought to solve a cellular problem. The three-dimensional structure of the basic cell of the various fabrics is very complex. Therefore and the mathematical study starts by meshing the different fabrics and which will enable us to take the geometry as well as the mechanical characteristics of the yarn into account and as well as the stresses applied. The application of this method first requires a mathematical formulation of the problem and then a mesh of the basic cell. The next step is the simulation of shearing and tensile tests. The analysis of the results has proved to be very hard and and thus and has demanded a study of the stress field in the basic cell. From the analysis of the plain weave behavior under those different tests we can assess that the yarn cross-section is one of the crucial factors that influences the mechanical behavior of fabrics and and the phenomenon of stress concentration appears to be located at the level of contact surfaces between warp and weft yarns. For all models that deal with the mechanical behavior of textile structures and regardless of the method of homogenization and the problem has to be solved at the basic cell level before moving on to the global model. The geometry of the textile structures is very complex due to the nonsymmetrical aspect of the majority of weaves. After having defined the geometrical form and completed the meshes of the basic cells of the plain weave and we have carried on the treatment of the problem from the mechanical point of view by the finite element method.},

Furthermore, no sample instrumentation is required, reducing substantially the global experimental procedure duration. The measurement technique consists in dissipating a known heat flux thanks to a home-designed thin heater, composed by two distinct heating elements and sandwiched between two cylindrical samples. The heater is also used as measurement instrument since micro-thermocouples are incorporated inside. The parameter estimation is performed by solving an inverse heat conduction problem. The method has been validated on a sample with known properties. The thermal properties of a unidirectional carbon-fiber composite have been then characterized. The results, obtained from a two-step estimation strategy are in good agreement with those determined within the framework of round-robin test. ¬{\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional microstructure of minerals and materials can be visualised in a non-destructive manner using X-ray microtomography. The digitised nature of the tomographic image allows us to generate finite element models which precisely detail the material‚{\"A}{\^o}s microstructure. With a high degree of automation, high resolution models can be created quickly and with little user interaction. The geometry is taken from the microtomographic data, and loads and boundary conditions are applied to the model to simulate various conditions. The finite element analysis results show the deformation and stress distribution in the material. The technique allows us to study the relationship between microstructure and bulk properties of porous minerals, to characterise them in terms of their strength and stiffness, and to simulate their behaviour under known loading conditions. In this paper we present an application of micro-finite element analysis in the study of porous minerals. Micro-finite element analysis can be used to study the behaviour of a variety of minerals, and is especially useful when applied to materials that have a distinct microstructure that affects their bulk properties.},

Both methods are compared with experimental results that are obtained by determining the fiber orientations of glass/PP woven composites thermoformed on an extended hemispherical shaped mould with different orientations of the blank. It was found that the kinematic mapping approach severely fails in predicting the fiber reorientation that occurs during stamp forming for non-symmetrical forming configurations. The FEM-simulation gives a reasonably good prediction of the fiber reorientation and seems the most promising technique in having good draping simulations.

Moreover, the idea of combining several components to produce a material with properties that are not attainable with the individual components has been used by humans for thousands of years. Correspondingly, the majority of natural materials that have emerged as a result of a prolonged evolution process can be treated as composite materials.},

The simulation of the production processes of these composite materials requires an accurate value for the permeability of the reinforcement used. Like other textiles, \{NCFs\} are porous media and have a permeability value in accordance with Darcy‚{\"A}{\^o}s law. At the K. U. Leuven, a dedicated solver has been developed for the computation of the permeability of textiles. The complex geometry of textiles and the fine fluid channels makes the computation of the permeability a challenge. \{NCFs\} are different to woven textiles. Here, the main source of scatter between experimental results is not nesting, but rather the size of the openings caused by the stitching. In this chapter, the numerical approach is explained in detail and the computed values are compared with experimentally obtained permeability data. A parametric study is performed to reveal the important characteristics that influence the permeability. Also, the influence of shearing on permeability is investigated.},

  abstract      = {The modeling of thermal behavior of composite parts during their forming requires an accurate knowledge of their thermo-physical properties. Because of the heterogeneous nature of composites, the thermal conductivity tensor appears to be the most tricky to determine experimentally but also to model. A wide range of experimental methods can be found in the literature in order to measure either in-plane or transverse conductivity of composite parts, but very few succeed in performing it on dry preform or uncured laminates. In this study, the effective thermal conductivity tensor of carbon/epoxy laminates is investigated experimentally in the three states of a typical LCM-process: dry-reinforcement, raw and cured composite. Samples are made of twill-weave carbon fabric impregnated with epoxy resin. The transverse thermal conductivity is determined using a classical estimation algorithm, whereas a special testing apparatus is designed to estimate in-plane conductivity for different temperatures and different states of the composite. Experimental results are then compared to modified Charles \& Wilson and Maxwell models. The fiber crimping of a ply is also taken into account in modeling. The comparison shows clearly that these models can be used to predict the effective thermal conductivities of woven-reinforced composites provided that the material properties are well known. ¬{\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed considerable differences when different test methods and aspect ratios and boundaries were used. A means of eliminating boundary condition effects and obtaining a true stress/strain relationship is indicated. Investigation of yarn slippage was also one of the major concerns in this study. Yarn slippage was found to be affected by non-uniformity of deformation and boundary conditions and differences in fabric materials. Tensile and out-of-plane bending tests were conducted. The shear and tensile stress/strain relationships were modelled. The test results also provide the thickness change during shear and unloading behaviour and bending rigidity and the efSect of wet-out on the maximum shear angle.},

	Abstract = {Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTPs) have made their way into the aerospace an automotive industries as structural components. Thermoplastic composites offer many advantages over thermoset composites such as low cycle time and recyclability. The development of a thermoforming process is complex and expensive to achieve by trial/error. This can be favourably replaced by numerical analyses. A simulation approach for thermoforming of multilayer thermoplastic is presented. Each prepreg layer is modelled by semi-discrete shell elements. These elements consider the tension, in-plane shear and bending behaviour of the ply at different temperatures around the fusion point. The contact/friction during the forming process is taken into account using forward increment Lagrange multipliers. A lubricated friction model is implemented between the layers and for ply/tool friction. Thermal and forming simulations are presented and compared to experimental results. The computed shear angles after forming and wrinkles are in good agreement with the thermoforming experiment. It will be shown by the comparison of two simulations that the temperature field play an important role in the process success. ¬{\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This paper establishes the concept of a digital-element. A digital-element model was developed to simulate textile processes and determine the micro-geometry of textile fabrics. It models yarns by a pin-connected digital-rod-element chain. As the element length approaches zero and the chain becomes fully flexible and imitating the physicality of yarns. Contacts between yarns are modeled by contact elements. If the distance between two nodes on different yarns approaches the yarn diameter and contact occurs between them. Yarn micro-structure inside the preform is determined by process mechanics and such as yarn tension and inter-yarn friction and compression. The textile process is modeled as a non-linear solid mechanics problem with boundary displacement (or motion) conditions. First and a simple twisting process is simulated and validating the digital-element model. Then and the yarn geometry of a 3-D and four-step braided preform is analyzed. These numerical results reveal the details of yarn paths within the preform. Such results can only be arduously and expensively obtained when achieved through experimental bservation and but cannot be generalized; or are inadequately detailed when achieved through existing analytical methods. This makes it possible and therefore and to conduct a quantitative analysis on the distribution of yarn orientation and fiber volume fraction inside a preform. Yet the value of this new model reaches far beyond that of the braiding process. As a general tool and it is advantageous for other textile processes and such as twisting and weaving and knitting and for the investigation of textile preform deformation during the consolidation process. The new numerical approach described here is identified as digital-element simulation rather than as finite-element simulation because of a special yarn discretization process. With the conventional finite-element approach and the element preserves the physical properties of the discretized body. In contrast and with this model the element itself does not preserve physical properties: physical properties are imitated by the element link. The concept is similar to digital discretization. Therefore and the term `digital element' is more appropriate. The size of the element must be very small compared to the size normally employed in finite element analysis.},

Picture frame shear tests on a glass weave and a glass-PP weave and a carbon NCF are presented. The glass-PP weave is also tested in biaxial tension and in shear at three different tensile preloads. It is concluded that full-field optical techniques are essential to reliably assess the textile deformation and homogeneity of loading in textile testing. Significant tensile{\~n}shear interaction is observed.

First and a direct and rigorous method is used to derive a simple formula for the gradient of the tensor-valued function defining a general class of strain measures. By means of this formula and the chain rule as well as Sylvester{\'\i}s formula for eigenprojections and explicit basis-free expressions for the material time rate of an arbitrary Lagrangean strain measure can be derived in terms of the right Cauchy{\~n}Green tensor and the material time rate of any chosen Lagrangean strain measure and e.g. Hencky{\'\i}s logarithmic strain measure. These results provide a new derivation of Carlson{\~n}Hoger{\'\i}s general gradient formula for an arbitrary generalized strain measure and supply a new and rigorous proof for Carlson{\~n}Hoger{\'\i}s conjecture concerning the n-dimensional case. Next and by virtue of the aforementioned gradient formula and a general fact for objective corotational rates and their defining spin tensors is disclosed: Let  D 7.B;D;W/ be any spin tensor that is continuous with respect to B and where B and D and W are the left Cauchy{\~n}Green tensor and the stretching tensor and the vorticity tensor.

	Abstract = {Thermoforming of woven fabric reinforced composites usually results in significant in-plane shear deformation in materials, and induces additional anisotropy into the composite. In this paper, a new constitutive model for characterizing the non-orthogonal material behavior under large deformation is proposed. On the basis of stress and strain analysis in the orthogonal and non-orthogonal coordinates and the rigid body rotation matrices, the relationship between the stresses and strains in the global coordinates is obtained. The equivalent material properties are then determined by fitting the numerical load vs. displacement curves to experimental results under biaxial tension and pure shear conditions. This model can be used to efficiently predict material responses under various loading paths for woven composites with different weave architectures. The geometrical non-linearity and the material non-linearity, as well as the complex redistribution and reorientation of the warp and weft yarns during deformation are taken into account. To demonstrate the performance of this model, numerical simulations using a commercial finite element package (ABAQUS/Standard) incorporated with our material model are conducted for various loading cases. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with experimental data.},

  abstract      = {First introduced over a decade ago, the Binary Model has evolved into a computationally efficient tool for predicting the properties of textile composites. Key to the formulation is the question of what details of the textile composite and the distributions of stress, strain, temperature, etc., are necessary and sufficient to represent the physics of the problem adequately and to ensure useful engineering predictions. This paper is concerned specifically with the prediction of the ultimate strength in cases where failure follows a single substantial local damage event, such as the rupture or kinking of a tow or the creation of a shear band mediated by matrix damage, without further increase in the external load. The accuracy of predictions is assessed for some triaxially braided carbon/epoxy composites. A gauge length is introduced that is suggested by the micromechanics of the failure mechanisms. Predictions are made by reference to strains that are averaged over a volume whose sides are commensurate with this gauge, but nevertheless retain spatial variations associated with the textile architecture. Failure criteria for tow rupture and matrix shear failure are taken from a single un-notched tensile test; the calibrated model then successfully predicts the failure mechanism (matrix shear or fiber rupture) and ultimate strength in un-notched and open-hole tension tests for any orientation of the textile fabric relative to the load axis, as well as bending and simple shear tests. The successful predictions are made using strains calculated for an entirely elastic representation of the material, which is possible because of the brittle character of the stress‚{\"A}{\`\i}strain curves. Predictions are also attempted using strains computed under the assumption that the textile material is homogeneous. These predictions are significantly inferior.},

	Abstract = {Since fiber reinforced composite materials have been used in main parts of structures and an accurate evaluation of their mechanical characteristics becomes very important. Due to their anisotropic nature and complicated architecture and it is very difficult to reveal the damage mechanisms of these materials from the results of mechanical tests. Therefore and there is a need to conduct reliable simulations and analytical evaluations. In this paper and the damage behavior of FRP is simulated by finite element analysis using an anisotropic damage model based on damage mechanics. The proposed procedure is applied to an example; the finite element analysis of microscopic damage propagation in woven fabric composites. Experimental tests have been conducted to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. It is recognized that there is a good agreement between the computational and experimental results and and that the proposed simulation method is very useful for the evaluation of damage mechanisms.},

Picture frame shear tests for the 3D woven pre-form were carried out, the non-linear curves of shear stress versus shear angle and the deformation mechanism were analyzed. Anew test method was designed to characterize the inter-ply shear property. The samples after interlaminar shear tests were also investigated through the yarn pulling-out and meso-structure to discover their deformation and failure mechanism. The results have shown that the fabric density has significantinfluenceon the in-plane shear and inter-ply shear properties of 3D angle interlock preforms and the shear performa nce decreases with the increasing of the fabric density. The lower fabric density, the better deformability. The inter-ply shear damage mode is the binder yarn pulling out from the fabric. It is expected that the study can provide an experimen tal basis for building up the theoretical model.},

	Abstract = {The concept of multi-chain digital element analysis is established. This new approach is a general numerical tool for textile mechanics. It can be used for textile process design and for fabric deformation and strength and failure analyses. In multi-chain digital analysis and fabric is considered as an assembly of yarns; furthermore and a yarn is considered as an assembly of fibers. Each fiber is modeled as a frictionless pin-connected rod element chain and defined as {\"e}{\"e}digital chain{\'\i}{\'\i}. Once the length of these rod elements approaches zero and the digital chain becomes a fully flexible one-dimensional entity with a circular cross section. It imitates the physicality of the fiber. Since a yarn is composed of many fibers and it is modeled as an assembly of digital chains. Contact between digital chains is modeled by contact elements. A procedure and similar to finite element analysis and is adopted. Displacement of fiber inside a fabric is derived based upon the global stiffness matrix and the boundary conditions. As a result and both detailed yarn paths and cross-section shape can be traced during the textile forming process or fabric deformation. In order to describe the new concept and two numerical examples are presented. The multi-chain digital element approach is used for the simulation of the two-dimensional weaving and three-dimensional braiding processes. One can observe and section-by-section and the yarn cross-section shape inside the woven and braided fabric.},

During a stamping process and the material undergoes large shear deformation and which may lead to two major failure mechanisms: out-of-plane wrinkling and in-plane slippage. The present paper mainly focuses on the large deformation mechanism and slippage of the plain woven composite during a bias extension. Bias extension experiments were carried out under different conditions. In addition to the data processing on the experimental curve and digital image correlation analysis was conducted on the test photographs and from which three typical deformation phases are identified. A theoretical model is then proposed to interpret the large deformation and slippage phenomenon from an energy point of view.},

Special care is taken to avoid hourglass modes and shear locking as well as volumetric locking. A unified framework for the 8-node hexahedral solid and thermal as well as thermomechanical coupling elements with uniform reduced integration (URI) and selective numerical integration (SI) schemes is developed. The approach is simply implemented by a small change of the standard technique and is applicable to arbitrary non-linear constitutive laws including isotropic and anisotropic material behaviors. The implementation of the proposed SI elements is straightforward, while the development of the proposed URI elements requires {\"e}anti-hourglass stresses{\'\i} which are evaluated by classical constitutive equations. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the suggested formulation, including mechanical problems, heat conduction and thermomechanical problems with emphasis on sheet forming processes.},

The purpose of the present work is to develop an efficient computational strategy in order to rapidly construct and numerically simulate multiscale representations of this class of materials.

  volume    = {40},
  abstract  = {Textile composite reinforcements are made up of fibres. Consequently
	and their mechanical behaviour is a result of the possible sliding
	and the interactions between the fibres. When they are formed on
	double curved shapes and these fabrics are submitted to large strains
	and in particular large in-plane shear. Among the mechanical behaviour
	models for these textile reinforcements and continuous models are
	most commonly used for forming simulations because they can be used
	with standard finite elements. The objective of the present paper
	is to propose a continuous approach for textile reinforcement deformation
	analysis based on a rate constitutive equation specific to materials
	made of fibres. The objective derivative of this constitutive model
	is defined by the fibre rotation. This constitutive model is implemented
	in ABAQUS and can be used in most commercial F.E. software. The approach
	is extended to materials with two-fibre directions in order to perform
	simulations of woven fabric forming processes. A set of simulations
	of large deformations of textile composite reinforcements at the
	mesoscopic scale (deformation of a woven unit cell) and at the macroscopic
	scale (deep drawing) is presented to show the efficiency of the proposed
	approach.},

  abstract  = {Rate constitutive equations (or hypoelastic constitutive equations)
	are frequently used in finite element software for finite strain
	analyses. For instance the material user subroutines of softwares
	such as ABAQUS are based on such approaches in the case of large
	deformations. Among these approaches and most of them use the standard
	Green Naghdi or Jaumann objective derivatives. The mechanical behaviour
	at finite strains of fibrous media (fabrics and composite reinforcements
	and NCF and etc.) is specific because of the possible sliding between
	fibres. The rate constitutive equations can be used if the fibrous
	medium is considered as a continuum. In this case and some approaches
	use the standard Green Naghdi or Jaumann objective derivatives and
	the associated rotated frame. The constitutive matrix in the rotated
	frame is obtained from the one in the fibre frame and which is the
	only frame where the specificities of the fibrous medium are exhibited.
	An alternative consists in defining and using an objective derivative
	and a rotated frame from the rotation of the fibre. The aim of this
	paper is to show that only the second approach leads to satisfying
	results for some tests and to explain the reasons why this second
	approach is preferable. This approach is also used to analyse at
	mesoscopic scale and in-plane shear deformation of a woven unit cell.},

  volume    = {40},
  abstract  = {The knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of woven fabrics is necessary
	in many applications in particular for the simulation of textile
	composite forming. This mechanical behaviour is very specific due
	to the possible motions between the fibres and the yarns. In this
	paper and the in-plane shear behaviour is analysed from virtual tests
	on the Representative Unit Cell. The in-plane shear strains can be
	very large (up to 50°) in case of draping on a double curved surface.
	These virtual tests avoid performing tricky experimental tests. The
	presented 3D finite element analyses involve two main specific aspects.
	Firstly the boundary conditions have to render the periodicity at
	large deformations and and in some cases and the evolution of contacts
	between neighbouring yarns during the motion. Secondly the yarn that
	is made of thousand of fibres is modelled as a continuous medium
	but its constitutive law has to take its fibrous nature into account.
	For that reason a rate constitutive equation using a specific objective
	stress rate is used. It is based on the rotation of the fibre. The
	analysis is performed for two unit cells. Both results are in good
	agreement with the experiments and but the use of one of the cells
	turns out to be much easier.},

  abstract  = {A hyperelastic constitutive law is proposed to describe the mechanical
	behaviour of fibre bundles of woven composite reinforcements. The
	objective of this model is to compute the 3D geometry of the deformed
	woven unit cell. This geometry is important for permeability calculations
	and for the mechanical behaviour of the composite into service. The
	finite element models of a woven unit cell can also be used as virtual
	mechanical tests. The highlight of four deformation modes of the
	fibre bundle leads to definition of a strain energy potential from
	four specific invariants. The parameters of the hyperelastic constitutive
	law are identified in the case of a glass plain weave reinforcement
	thanks to uniaxial and equibiaxial tensile tests on the fibre bundle
	and on the whole reinforcement. This constitutive law is then validated
	in comparison to biaxial tension and in-plane shear tests.},

	dans l’étude des propriétés microstructurales de ces matériaux. Un

	fibres de bois, est
	
	retenu par le consortium Silent Wall pour ses bonnes propriétés d’isolation

	X, sont analysées par morphologie mathématique afin de caractériser
	la microstructure
	
	de ses phases fibreuse et porale. Un modèle booléen de cylindres aléatoires
	permet de
	
	simuler un tel matériau fibreux. L’adéquation des mesures morphologiques

	d’absorption acoustique
	
	des milieux fibreux simulés sont en adéquation avec les valeurs expérimentales

A tensor is understood to be an invariant quantity with respect to any co-ordinate system transformation, which justifies the use of absolute notation preferred in this work. As a most important application field of fourth-order tensors, elastic moduli are formulated in a material and a spatial description and given for various hyperelastic material models.},

An experimental study was performed using pre-stacked UD prepreg on a forming tool with varying cross sections. Parameters studied include local interply friction, effects of co-stacking and fibre stresses in critical fibre directions. Experimental evaluation was performed on out-of-plane defect height, type and location. The study shows that fibre stresses in some fibre directions were crucial for the shearing required to avoid wrinkling. The same fibre stresses may cause wrinkling if the lamina is stacked in a non-beneficial order. Changing the friction locally, or reducing the number of difficult combinations of fibre angles, improves the forming outcome slightly. However, in order to make a significant improvement, co-stacking or different fibre stacking is required.},

  abstract   = {When manufacturing composite aircraft components consisting of uni-directional prepreg laminates, Hot Drape Forming (HDF) is sometimes used. One issue with HDF is that, in contrast to hand lay-up where normally only one ply is laid up at a time, multiple plies are formed together. This limits the in-plane deformability of the stack, thus increasing the risk of out-of-plane wrinkling during forming. In this paper mechanisms responsible for creating different types of wrinkles are explained. It is shown through simulations how the wrinkles are created as a result of interaction between two layers with specific fibre directions or due to compression of the entire stack. The simulations are compared to experimental results with good agreement.},

An experimental study is performed with pre-stacked UD prepreg on a forming tool with varying cross section. Investigated parameters include lay-up sequence, prepreg ply thickness, inter-ply friction and prepreg ply impregnation. Experimental evaluation is performed on the out-of-plane defect height, type, location and number. Further, measurements are performed on the outer-ply deformation in the z-direction and inside the formed component using Micro CT.

In-plane fibre misalignments also cause reductions in the compressive strength, yet the origins of these defects are misunderstood. This paper presents a new mechanism for the formation of wrinkles, which is based upon the shear forces generated as a result of mismatches in the coefficient of thermal expansion of composite and tool, as well as the process of ply slippage that occurs during consolidation into radii. Using a U-shaped tool, defects in composite spars have been characterised using light microscopy, showing that the tool geometry and prepreg bridging leads to “instability sites,” which lead to wrinkles up to 750 μm in height as well as in-plane misalignment of 0° plies of up to 50°. Increasing the frictional shear stress through omission of release film prevents the formation of wrinkles, supporting the mechanism presented in this paper.},

  abstract  = {The structural theories used to model the global behavior of laminated composite plates fall into the category of “equivalent single layer (ESL) theories”. In these theories, the material properties of the constituent layers through the thickness are “smeared” to form an equivalent single layer plate. The present study deals with an evaluation of various ESL theories, including the third-order shear deformation theories, in predicting global response characteristics of composite laminates. In this work, all commonly used, displacement-based theories are unified as special cases of the general third order theory developed by Reddy [1,2] with the introduction of “tracers”. The equations of motion, analytical solutions, and finite element models have been derived for the unified theory, and the other theories simply fall out from this by proper assignment of tracers. Due to the space limitation, details of the theoretical development are omitted and only few representative results are presented here.},

  abstract = {The thermostamping process used to fabricate thermoplastic prepreg composites is widely studied due to its use in several applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. In recent years, different constitutive mechanical models and new numerical techniques have been proposed to simulate this process. However, from an experimental point of view, no substantial progress has been recorded on the experimental methods used for the characterisation of thermostamped thermoplastic prepreg composites. Moreover, there is currently no experimental protocol to visualize or analyse deformation fields at temperatures above the melting point of a material during the characterisation process. The knowledge of these fields allows precision modelling of the mechanical behaviour of this type of material. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a new experimental protocol that uses a digital image correlation method, which faces constraints such as light reflections on either the yarns or the molten thermoplastic matrix. The proposed solution uses an ultraviolet light source and a photoluminescent powder to make the speckle pattern. This approach avoids any visible reflections, since the sample itself is the visible light source.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown aetiology. It is suggested to involve both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors including in the latter environmental toxins. Human exposure to the environmental toxin aluminium has been linked, if tentatively, to autism spectrum disorder. Herein we have used transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure, for the first time, the aluminium content of brain tissue from donors with a diagnosis of autism. We have also used an aluminium-selective fluor to identify aluminium in brain tissue using fluorescence microscopy. The aluminium content of brain tissue in autism was consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium content across all 5 individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) μg/g dry wt. for the occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human brain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe of a 15year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) μg/g dry wt.? Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used to identify aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was imaged associated with neurones it appeared to be present intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the meninges, vasculature, grey and white matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated with non-neuronal cells was a standout observation in autism brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the brain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum disorder.},

However the mechanics during the test involves fibrous material at large shear strains and large rotations of the fibres. Several aspects are still being studied and are not yet modeled in a consensual manner. The standard analysis of the test is based on two assumptions: inextensibility of the fibers and rotations at the yarn crossovers without slippage. They lead to the development of zones with constant fibre orientations proper to the bias-extension test. Beyond the analysis of the test within these basic assumptions, the paper presents studies that have been carried out on the lack of verification of these hypothesis (slippage, tension in the yarns, effects of fibre bending). The effects of temperature, mesoscopic modeling and tension locking are also considered in the case of the bias-extension test.},

During forming, defects can occur and have to be taken into account because they can significantly affect the mechanical performance of the part. This experimental study shows that, when working with dry fabric forming, the type and number of defects is a function of the punch geometry, the process parameters, the orientation of the fabric with respect to the punch and the inter-ply friction. Inter-ply friction has a huge effect on the quality of the preform when inter-ply sliding occurs. This inter-ply friction leads to several overhanging yarn shocks that generate high tangential forces, which inhibit the relative sliding of plies. In addition, to reduce the number and amplitude of defects, the layers subjected to severe defects can be placed in the inner position where they are subjected to the compression applied by the upper layers.},

  abstract = {Continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites are promising materials for light-weight structural components. Their medium to high processing and temperature-dependent properties, and the complex deformation mechanisms that occur within the composite sheet during the forming, are main problems in the practical production of parts. Thermoforming is an effective fabrication method due to the reversible solid–liquid phase transformation of thermoplastic materials. Deep drawing of these materials involves heating the composite to its melt/softening temperature and then applying suitable force to form the composite to the required shape. In the present study the influence of essential processing parameters on the forming behavior and quality of the profiles was examined experimentally. The base material was polypropylene and unidirectional glass fibers were used as reinforcement. The appropriate processing temperature, pressure and heating time for producing and deep drawing of thermoplastic composite sheet obtained. In order to study the process analytically, finite element ABAQUS software package has been employed. In this investigation, fiber properties gained from experiments were considered. Finally, apparent deformation of fibers and logarithmic axial strain are compared between ABAQUS and experimental results and these comparisons are represented graphically. Consequently these comparisons lead to optimum film stacking among selected lay-ups to prevent wrinkling in deep drawing process.},

  abstract = {One of the components required for design and optimisation of fabric reinforced products is a realistic and accurate 3-D geometry model for a repeating element of the reinforcement. Such a model, which reflects the deformations that result from weaving the fibre bundles and forming (draping) the woven fabric over a product mould, is proposed in the present paper. A fibre bundle architecture, which exhibits undulation and variable cross-section dimensions, is introduced to this effect. Every bundle is described by its in-plane centreline path, its double curved horizontal midplane and the thickness distribution of the cross-sections. These parameters are, in turn, defined by invariant shape functions and variable fibre bundle dimensions. The selected geometry description enables straightforward determination of individual fibre paths. In order to verify the model experimentally, cross-sections are cut out from undeformed laminates with plain-weave reinforcements, and laminates of which the plain-weaves have been subjected to stretching or shear deformations during draping. The laminate cross-sections are made along and perpendicular to the mean directions of the impregnated fibre bundles (yarns). All yarns exhibit out-of-plane undulation, and curvature and twist of the midplane. Correlation between experiment and the proposed modeling scheme is good. Draping results in significant fibre reorientations and variations between the individual fibre paths, which are not reflected by existing modeling schemes. These geometry deviations may significantly affect the stress distribution, and should be taken into account in order to predict material properties accurately.},

  abstract = {Meso-scale (unit cell of an impregnated textile reinforcement) finite element (FE) modelling of textile composites is a powerful tool for homogenisation of mechanical properties and study of stress–strain fields inside the unit cell and determination of damage initiation conditions and sites and simulation of damage development and associated deterioration of the homogenised mechanical properties of the composite. Meso-FE can be considered as a part of the micro-meso–macro multi-level modelling process and with micro-models (fibres in the matrix) providing material properties for homogenised impregnated yarns and fibrous plies and and macro-model (structural analysis) using results of meso-homogenisation. The paper discusses stages of the meso-FE analysis and proposes a succession of steps (‘‘road map’’) and the corresponding algorithms for it: (1) Building a model of internal geometry of the reinforcement; (2) Transferring the geometry into a volume description (‘‘solid’’ CAD-model); (3) Preparation for meshing: correction of the interpenetration of volumes of yarns in the solid model and providing space for the thin matrix layers between the yarns; (4) Meshing; (5) Assigning local material properties of the impregnated yarns and the matrix; (6) Definition of the minimum possible unit cell using symmetry of the reinforcement and assigning periodic boundary conditions; (7) Homogenisation procedure; (8) Damage initiation criteria; (9) Damage propagation modelling. The ‘‘road map’’ is illustrated by examples of meso-FE analysis of woven and braided composites.},

  volume   = {2},
  abstract = {Fabric drapes are typical large displacement and large rotation and small strain problems. Compared with continuum shell finite element methods and methods that skeletonize the fabric sheet into a set of interconnected nodes appear to be more popular in drape problems with extensive wrinkles. These skeletal methods may resort to particle mechanics and formulate the elastic energy or the equations of motion in terms of the node-to-node distance and the angles between the straight lines joining adjacent nodes. Alternatively and beam elements can be employed to skeletonize the fabric sheet at the expense of using rotational in addition to translational nodal DOFs. In this paper and a new skeletal model based on the small strain and curvature assumptions is devised. In contrast to most and if not all and skeletal models for fabric drape simulation and all the stretching and shearing and bending energies in the model are simple polynomials of the gridpoint displacement. Fabric drape problems with extensive wrinkles are examined. The presence of sharp fold and seam and cut in the undeformed fabric sheet as well as fabric-to-solid contact are considered. The predicted appearances are pleasant and conform to real life observations.},

Here and detailed prescriptions are given for the constitutive laws of the computational elements in terms of the properties of the constituent materials and the geometry of the fiber reinforcement. The application studied is to woven composites with 3D interlock reinforcement. Predicted macroscopic elastic constants agree with experimental values without the use of adjustable parameters. The Binary Model also shows how the waviness of nominally straight tows in 3D weaves affects the statistics of local stresses. Through-thickness reinforcement also disorders local stresses and but its effect is found generally to be much less than that of tow waviness for current 3D woven composites. For predicting the onset of failure and it is inferred that treating the stochastic effects of tow irregularity is much more important than modeling the influence of local tow configurations in great detail.},

  abstract = {The potential of plant fibres in structural materials components is explored by applying textile hemp yarn for fabrication of composites with aligned fibres. This first paper presents a detailed characterisation of the hemp yarn. It is shown that the hemp yarn has a high cellulose content (about 90\%) and the fibres are evenly dispersed within the yarn with a mean twisting angle of about 11∞ and the moisture sorption capacity is relatively low (e.g. moisture content of about 8\% at 65\% RH) and and the mechanical properties are good (e.g. tensile ultimate stress of about 660 MPa). These findings show that textile hemp yarn is well suited for composite reinforcement. The companying second paper is addressing the mechanical properties of the composites.},

  pages    = {860ñ869},
  volume   = {40},
  abstract = {Fluid flow analyses for porous media are of great importance in a wide range of industrial applications including, but not limited to, resin transfer moulding, filter analysis, transport of underground water and pollutants, and hydrocarbon recovery. Permeability is perhaps the most important property that characterizes porous media; however, its determination for different types of porous media is challenging due its complex dependence on the pore-level structure of the media. In the present work, fluid flow in three-dimensional random fibrous media is simulated using the lattice Boltzmann method. We determine the permeability of the medium using the Darcy law across a wide range of void fractions (0.08 6 / 6 0.99) and find that the values for the permeability that we obtain are consistent with available experimental data. We use our numerical data to develop a semi-empirical constitutive model for the permeability of fibrous media as a function of their porosity and of the fibre diameter. The model, which is underpinned by the theoretical analysis of flow through cylinder arrays presented by [Gebart BR. Permeability of unidirectional reinforcements for RTM. J Compos Mater 1992; 26(8): 1100ñ33], gives an excellent fit to these data across the range of /. We perform further simulations to determine the impact of the curvature and aspect ratio of the fibres on the permeability. We find that curvature has a negligible effect, and that aspect ratio is only important for fibres with aspect ratio smaller than 6:1, in which case the permeability increases with increasing aspect ratio. Finally, we calculate the permeability tensor for the fibrous media studied and confirm numerically that, for an isotropic medium, the permeability tensor reduces to a scalar value.},

  abstract = {Finite element modeling of the impact of flexible woven fabrics using a yarn level architecture allows the capturing of complex projectile-fabric and yarnñyarn level interactions and however it requires very large computational resources. This paper presents a multiscale modeling technique to simulate the impact of flexible woven fabrics. This technique involves modeling the fabric using a yarn level architecture around the impact region and a homogenized or membrane type architecture at far field regions. The level of modeling resolution decreases with distance away from the impact zone. This results in a finite element model with much lower computational requirements. The yarns are modeled using both solid and shell finite elements. Impedances are matched across all interfaces created between the various regions of the model to prevent artificial reflections of the longitudinal strain waves. A systematic approach is presented to determine geometric and material parameters of the homogenized zone. The multiscale model is extensively validated against baseline models. The limitations of using shell elements to model the yarn level architecture underneath the projectile are addressed.},

  abstract = {In this work and a multi scale modeling approach has been developed to simulate the impact of woven fabrics using a finite element (FE) analysis. A yarn level of resolution is used in the model. This approach and referred to as the hybrid element analysis (HEA) is based on decreasing the complexity of the finite element model with distance away from the impact zone based on the multiscale nature of the fabric architecture and the physics of the impact event. Solid elements are used to discretize the yarns around the impact region and which transition to shell elements in the surrounding region. A new method for modeling the shell yarns is incorporated that more accurately represents the contours of the yarn cross section. Impedances have been matched across the solideshell interface to prevent interfacial reflections of the longitudinal strain wave. The HEA method is validated by first applying it to the FE model of a single yarn for which an analytical solution is known. The HEA method is then applied to a woven fabric model and validated by comparing it against a baseline model consisting of yarns discretized using only solid elements.},

To better predict local laminate quality and the long-term goal is to simulate meso flow around fibre bundles.

The aim of the present paper is to evaluate micro-computed tomography (lCT) as a tool to determine the geometry of fibre bundles and voids in glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP). The resolution of the used lCT enabled visualization of each fibre bundle separately and of inter bundle voids. Using post-processing techniques and the data of the lCT can be converted to finite element models. These models can be taken as input for future Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.},

This chapter presents an introduction of explicit finite element methods with an emphasis on the topics that distinguish the explicit formulation from the more traditional implicit one, including stable time step size estimation, energy conservation, shock viscosities, zero energy modes, and stress rotations.}
